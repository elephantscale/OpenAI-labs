## Course Outline

### Focus Areas
- Focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to build your first AI agent.
- Deploy your Azure OpenAI Service instance.
- Test the API.
- Set up an orchestration engine like LangChain to enable these scenarios.

### Lesson 1 and Lesson 2
- Build an AI agent using LangChain and Azure OpenAI.
- Load tabular data from a CSV file.
- Perform natural language queries using the Azure OpenAI Service to extract information.
- Learn to reapply the agent to analyze your own CSV files.

### Lesson 3
- Implement LangChain agents to connect to a provided SQL database.
- Build a DB agent that translates natural language to SQL code.

### Lesson 4
- Use Azure OpenAI Service’s function calling feature.
- Utilize pre-built functions for sending queries to databases.
- Improve the efficiency and security of your SQL agent.

### Lesson 5
- Work with the Assistants API.
- Test it with the function calling and code interpreter features.
- Enable connection to SQL databases and create your own DB agents more efficiently.


### Lesson 6
- Build A dialogue feature extraction pipeline using function calling!
