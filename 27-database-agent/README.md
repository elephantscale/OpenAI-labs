# Building Your Own Database Agent

In **Building Your Own Database Agent lab**, we will develop an AI agent that interacts with databases using natural language, simplifying the process for querying and extracting insights. 

## Course outline:

- **Create a virtual environment using the project requirements**
     - Open any directory with your source files that contains the requirements.txt file: select File | Open from the main menu and choose the directory.
     - If no virtual environment has been created for this project, PyCharm suggests creating it.
     - Click Create a virtual environment using requirements.txt.
     - Keep the suggested options, or specify the environment location or base Python interpreter. Click OK to complete the task.
     - Once you click OK, PyCharm creates an environment and installs all the required packages.


- **Focus areas**:
  - Focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to build your first AI agent.
  - Deploy your Azure OpenAI Service instance.
  - Test the API.
  - Set up an orchestration engine like LangChain to enable these scenarios.

- **Lesson-1 and Lesson-2 focus on**:
  - Build an AI agent using langchain and Azure OpenAI
  - Load tabular data from a CSV file
  - Perform natural language queries using the Azure OpenAI Service to extract information.
  - Learn to reapply the agent to analyze your own CSV files.

- **Lesson-3 focus on implementing LangChain agents to connect to a provided SQL database**:
  - Build a DB agent that translates natural language to SQL code.

- **Lesson-4 focus on using Azure OpenAI Serviceâ€™s function calling feature**:
  - Utilize pre-built functions for sending queries to databases.
  - Improve the efficiency and security of your SQL agent.

- **Lesson 5 focus on work with the Assistants API**:
  - Test it with the function calling and code interpreter features.
  - Enable connection to SQL databases and create your own DB agents more efficiently.
