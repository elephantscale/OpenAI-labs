## Overview

This lab focuses on the following key points:
- Extending LLMs with custom functionality via function-calling, enabling them to form calls to external functions.
- Extracting structured data from natural language inputs, making real-world data usable for analysis.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Function-Calling
- Integrate function-calling in detail. Construct prompts with function definitions and utilize LLM responses to execute these functions.

### Lesson 2: Complex Function Calls
- Learn how LLMs can handle multiple function calls, including parallel and nested calls. This capability enables creating intricate agent workflows where an LLM plans and executes a sequence of function calls to accomplish tasks.

### Lesson 3: Using OpenAPI Specifications
- Construct function calls that interact with web services using OpenAPI specifications. This allows LLMs to access and utilize data from external APIs seamlessly.

### Lesson 4: Extracting Structured Data
- Use function-calling to extract structured data from natural language inputs. This feature enhances the ability to parse and utilize information contained within unstructured textual data.

### Lesson 5: Automating Tasks
- Build applications that automate tasks, such as generating SQL queries from customer service transcripts. LLM-generated commands can be used to execute database operations efficiently.
