# Fine-tuning with HuggingFace

* In this lab we will practice fine-tuning an OpenAI model

* A practical example of fine-tuning would be using the Hugging Face Transformers library to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on a custom dataset. In this example, we'll fine-tune GPT-2 on a dataset of movie reviews to generate movie review-like text.

### Lab Goals:

### STEP 0) Login to the server

* Each student is provided their individual server and credentials

* (Instructor: use our ubuntu AMI, t2.large or t2.xlarge instances 



### STEP 1) Prepare your dataset: 

* For this example, you can use the IMDb dataset available from TensorFlow Datasets. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imdb_reviews

### STEP 2) Set up the environment: 

* Install the Hugging Face Transformers library (https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and other necessary dependencies using pip:

### STEP 3) Install the packages in the shell 

```shell
pip install transformers
pip install tensorflow
pip install torch
```

### STEP 4) Preprocess the data:

* Tokenize the movie reviews using the GPT-2 tokenizer, and convert them into input tensors.

### STEP 5) Fine-tune GPT-2: 

* Use the Trainer class from Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune the GPT-2 model. Set appropriate training parameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. Here's a link to a detailed tutorial on fine-tuning GPT-2 using Hugging Face Transformers: https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate

### STEP 6) Evaluate and test the model: 

* After fine-tuning, evaluate the model on a separate dataset to ensure it generalizes well to new data. Test the model by generating new movie reviews using the generate() method from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### STEP 7) This example provides a high-level overview of the fine-tuning process. 

* You may need to modify the code and adjust hyperparameters based on your specific requirements and resources.

### STEP 8) Congrats!
