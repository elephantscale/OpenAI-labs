# Speech to text

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text

* In this lab we will practice how to turn audio into text

### Introduction:

* The speech to text API provides two endpoints, transcriptions and translations, based on our state-of-the-art open source large-v2 Whisper model. They can be used to:

    - Transcribe audio into whatever language the audio is in.

    - Translate and transcribe the audio into english.

* File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB and the following input file types are supported: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, and webm.

## Quickstart

### Transcriptions

* The transcriptions API takes as input the audio file you want to transcribe and the desired output file format for the transcription of the audio

### Translations

* The translations API takes as input the audio file in any of the supported languages and transcribes, if necessary, the audio into english.

* This differs from our /Transcriptions endpoint since the output is not in the original input language and is instead translated to english text.
