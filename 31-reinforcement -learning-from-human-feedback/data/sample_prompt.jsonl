Later when I was getting to know my suitemates, I asked them if they ever used reddit, and they showed me the stencil they used to spray that!

{"input_text": "Nooooooo, I loved my health class! My teacher was amazing! Most days we just went outside and played and the facility allowed it because the health teacher's argument was that teens need to spend time outside everyday and he let us do that. The other days were spent inside with him teaching us how to live a healthy lifestyle. He had guest speakers come in and reach us about nutrition and our final was open book...if we even had a final.... [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "Unlike Python (and some other packages), this isn't a situation where you get to choose which version you're running. Staying up with the latest major version is vital as they address bug and security fixes. There have been some major performance gains in the last few releases as well.

{"input_text": "You could be in the right or in the wrong, depending on what server it was. If it was on a community server, like a 24/7 Hightower server especially, then there is sort of an unwritten rule that you don't tryhard on Hightower. But if it was on a valve server then odds are more people than just you will want to cap, so it becomes an objective map again. However, it seems in your experience it was not a tryhard server, because you thought that it was easy to cap, and you only had one team mate helping you. This means the enemy team rarely tried to stop you, and that most of your team mates were just messing around. If you like playing the objective on Hightower, go to a valve server. You were right to ask however, I see too many people just ignorantly making everyone else have  a bad time without concern. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "300 hrs in a month? My hrs are spread over the entire development of the mod, from beginning to end. It's been a fun ride, but constant re-looting has gotten tedious to say the least. \nYou're right about it being better than standalone, but I've moved on from this \"broken\" genre for now. \n >Especially considering the devs do it all for free. Yea they get donations, \n Get real. Donations are huge. I bought a private server during the dayz hayday. Made $800/month clear above expenses. Only had a few hundred regular players. It pays a lot more than working min wage. So don't pretend they are making the mod out of the goodness of their hearts, that's actually silly. [summary]: "}
{"input_text": "I'm getting my PhD in chemistry, and I hope to become a professor at a liberal arts college. I have been accepted to three schools. One is top tier, one is mid tier, and one is bottom tier. (All three are RU/VH.) I'm having a hard time with the decision, and I need some insight. \n \n I want to be close to family:\nBottom tier school is 30 minutes away. It's in my home state. I would be happy to teach at some of the schools in my home state. \n \n Research is not the most important thing in my life:\nI am not a workaholic. I will not stay awake thinking about my work until the wee hours in the morning. The top tier school is a pressure cooker, and I'm more likely to have mental health issues if I go there. Mid tier is slightly more laid back, but it's still grad school. 5th year grad students at the bottom tier school said that 40-50 hours a week is the norm. It is a very relaxed department. \n \n I want to like the research at least a little:\nTop school is amazing. Everything is awesome. Funding and resources are not even a little bit of an issue. \nMid school has cool stuff happening. I would be happy doing that work.\nBottom tier school has only one professor I would want to work for, and even that research wasn't that exciting to me. [summary]: "}
