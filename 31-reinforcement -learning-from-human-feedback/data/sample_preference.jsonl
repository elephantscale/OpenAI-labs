{"input_text": "Dear people on Reddit,\n\nMy husband is American and I'm a foreigner so we applied for a K1 visa which is basically \" a visa issued to the fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e of a United States citizen to enter the United States. A K-1 visa requires a foreigner to marry his or her U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days of entry, or depart the United States.\"\n\nWith this visa I need to get married in the USA and I cannot leave USA until I adjust my status, which can takes several months. This means I can't leave USA to go to a honeymoon or to do a second wedding in my home country. \nThe thing is that I have lived in several countries and have friends and family all around the world so I don't even know how to start planning something. I had several ideas of weddings in the USA but either my fianc\u00e9 didn't like or it was too expensive. I wanted to get married in a cruise (to Alaska), fianc\u00e9 agreed but there is something called Jones act that says that every cruise must pass through foreigner ports so even if we go to Alaska, the cruise would go through Canadian waters.\n\nI really do not want a background wedding, although this would be a reasonable choice. \n\nI would like to have some ideas of really small destination wedding because if we get married only with our parents (and fiance's closest friends/family) present, it would be the best option because I  wouldn't be happy having huge a wedding where my best friends and family couldn't attend. \n\nFianc\u00e9 lives in Mississippi and I would like to go to somewhere snowy (we are planning to get married during xmas holiday)\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy trying to plan something in those circumstances.

{"input_text": "Hey guys, I'm having a really frustrating time with one of my computers in my home, and I'm wondering about ways in which I can fix it.\n\nThis is the situation: I built a computer 3 years ago (April '07).  It ran perfectly with occasional hiccups due to viruses and such for two years, but for the past year or so it has been almost unbearable to use according to my family members.  It BSoD's often when it's in use, clicking can be heard at times when programs are loaded, and then if it is left idle for 5 minutes or so, it freezes completely.  The screen still shows everything that was occurring, but is completely unresponsive.\n\nNow, the BSoD's I think has to do with a hardware component of the computer failing, and the clicking leads me to believe it's the hard drive (It basically sounds like something that happens whenever the hard drive is required to start up).  I'm already looking into getting a new hard drive for it and hooking it up, which I feel would solve these two problems (potentially).\n\nThe one I have trouble with it is the random freezing.  I hate that I can't run AV scans or leave it to do anything without coming back and moving the mouse or typing something constantly.  I've tried looking for OS updates (Vista), installing new drivers for just about everything on the computer, and removing almost all of the junk that was on it, yet I'm still getting the same problem.\n\nAnyway, I was just wondering if anyone had experienced the same problem(s) before and could offer any help.  I'll be home from work in a couple of hours and can give specific details if you guys think it'd be useful.
