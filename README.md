# OpenAI labs

The preparation steps in this 'README' apply to all subsequent labs.

## Lab Goals:
 
### STEP 1) Lab environment

The instructor will provide a server with SSH access

### STEP 2) Login 

Login with the credentials provided by the instructor

Nothing is needed, instructor will provide the link 

### STEP 3) To view the labs locally

Markdown (`*.md`) files are plain text files and can be viewed in any text editor.

For best viewing experience we recommend the following setup:

* Get Chrome browser from [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
* Install Markdown [preview plus plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-preview-plus/febilkbfcbhebfnokafefeacimjdckgl?hl=en-US)
* Once installed, go to 'Window --> Extensions' menu of Chrome ;   Find 'Markdown Preview Plus' plugin ;  set 'Allow access to file urls'
* Open any `*.md` file using Chrome (File --> Open)

### If you need to edit a file

We recommend using a 'programmer's editor to view these files. These editors have integrated file browser and allows navigating through files quickly.
