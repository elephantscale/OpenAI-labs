# OpenAI labs
## Workflow (per lab)

1. From the repo root, run the lab setup:
   - `./setup.sh <lab-path>`
   - Example: `./setup.sh labs/python-rag`

2. Change into the lab directory:
   - `cd <lab-path>`

3. Activate the lab’s virtual environment (optional, but convenient for CLI work):
   - `source .venv/bin/activate`

4. Run the notebooks in that lab.
   - In Jupyter, make sure the notebook kernel is set to the lab kernel:
     - **Kernel → Change Kernel → `Lab: <lab-name>`**

5. When you’re done (optional):
   - `deactivate`
