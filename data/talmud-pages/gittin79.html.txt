Gittin 79 - Get is Thrown from the Roof If she was standing on top of a roof that belonged to her and he threw the Get from the courtyard that belonged to him, - once it reaches the airspace of the roof, she is divorced. If he was on his roof above and she was in her courtyard below, and he threw the Get to her, once it leaves the domain of the roof - even if it is erased or burnt before it lands in the courtyard - she is divorced. After the Get is written, the husband and wife can not be alone together. Talk to MosesAI about it
