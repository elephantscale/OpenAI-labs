Kiddushin 54 - Misappropriation If one betroths a woman with second tithe (produce separated from the crops which must be brought to Jerusalem and eaten there), he has not betrothed her, because second tithe is not his but Divine property (accepted ruling of Rabbi Meir). If one betroths a woman with property belonging to the Temple treasury, then, if he did this by mistake, the property first became his, and even though he committed misappropriation, the betrothal took effect. If, on the other hand, he did it knowingly, then the property remained consecrated, not his, and the betrothal did not work (accepted ruling of Rabbi Yehudah). Talk to MosesAI about it
