Menachot 78 - Offerings Coming with Bread In addition to the offering of thanksgiving, which required forty loaves of bread, two more offerings also came required bread: the one-time inauguration offering of Aaron and his sons, and the offering of a nazir. The inauguration offering required only the non-leaved parts of the thanksgiving offering, that is, oven-baked loaves, wafers, and loaves first scalded in water. The offering of a nazir required only the first two types, that is, oven-baked loaves and wafers. Usually, an animal becomes an offering when the owner designates it as such, and then it cannot be used for any other purpose. The breads that accompany a thanksgiving offering becomes sanctified not by owner's declaration, but by the slaughter of the animal. Thus, if he slaughtered the animal while the breads were outside the Courtyard, the bread did not become sanctified. Likewise, if the breads were still baking when he slaughtered the offering and their surface did not crust, or even of all the loaves crusted except one, the bread did not become sanctified.
