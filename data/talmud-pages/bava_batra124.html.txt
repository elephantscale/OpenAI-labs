Bava Batra 124 - Limitations to the Double Portion of the Firstborn What is the status of the benefits that accrue to the father's estate after his death but before the division, such as a calf born of a cow in the estate, or a loan repaid to the estate? Rabbis: the firstborn does not take the double portion of that; Rebbi: the firstborn takes a double portion of those benefits that happen automatically, but not those that the orphans brought to the estate through their actions. What are their arguments? Rabbis: the expression "...to give him the double portion..." compares the double portion to a gift. Just as a gift cannot be given unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the double portion include only present assets. Rebbi: the words "...double portion..." make the law for both portions the same, to include future automatic benefits. George W.
