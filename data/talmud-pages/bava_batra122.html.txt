Bava Batra 122 - Daughters are Supported From the Father's Estate Both a son and a daughter (where there are no sons) are equal with respect to inheriting from a mother's estate and a father's estate. However, there are some differences. A son who is a firstborn takes a double portion of his father's estate, but he does not take a double portion of his mother's estate - since "...to him is the right of the firstborn" can be understood to say that "regarding him, that is, the father, the right of the firstborn applies." The daughters are supported from the father's estate until they marry, but they are not supported from the mother's estate.
