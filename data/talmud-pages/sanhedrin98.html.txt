Sanhedrin 98 - The Signs of the Coming of the Mashiach Said Rabbi Abba, - There is no clearer indication of the "End" than this: "But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel...", that is, the Land of Israel will yield fruit in abundance shortly before the redemption. In the generation of the Messiah, there will be denunciation among the Torah scholars. The Messiah will come to the generation that is completely virtuous or completely sinful. If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to repent, because he focuses on his good attributes. On the other hand, one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's redemption. The coming of the Messiah will be preceded by multiple troubles and tribulations. Ulla said, "May he come, but may I not see him," but Rav Yosef said, "May he come, and may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung!"
