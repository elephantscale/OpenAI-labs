Keritot 14 - One Meal, Five Transgressions One can eat a piece of food and be liable for four sin-offerings and a guilt-offering: if he was ritually impure and ate prohibited fat, which was left over from sacrifices, on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Meir says that if it was Shabbat and he carried food in this mouth, he is liable for a fifth sin-offering, but the Sages respond that it doesn't come it, since it is a different group of prohibitions. What is the count? He (1) ate sacrificial meat in the state of ritual impurity, (2) ate prohibited fat, (3) ate leftover sacrifices, (4) ate on Yom Kippur. Additionally, since the fat was from a consecrated animal, he used consecrated property and needs to bring a guilt-offering. One can do a single act of cohabitation and be liable for six sin-offerings: if he cohabits with his daughter, who is his sister, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, a married woman, and was not in a mikva. How is that possible? He had an incestuous relationship with his mother, from which a daughter was born. The daughter married his (paternal) brother. After her husband died, this daughter married his father's brother. He then had committed incest with her, without her going to the mikva.
