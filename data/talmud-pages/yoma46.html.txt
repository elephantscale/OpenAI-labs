Yoma 46 - The fourth pyre The fourth pyre on the Altar - which was only required according to Rabbi Meir - was for burning the limbs of the daily offering on those days when some were left from the previous night. It was fired even on Shabbat, and therein lies the problem: lighting fire on Shabbat is prohibited. We understand that the Temple service overrides this rule, but to what extent? Therefore, Rav Avin qualified it: the pyre is started even for invalid (such as ritually impure) parts, but only if a fire had singed them. Two potential prohibitions need to be overridden when burning sacrifices in the Temple: Shabbat and ritual impurity. Rav Huna said it is the first one overridden but not the second one, and Rabbah said it is only the second one. Abaye asked a question that is a problem equally for both: the Torah said, "Bring the sacrifice in its time," which seems to mean, "even on Shabbat and even if ritually impure." Why prefer one exemption and leave out the other? However, both have their answers. Rabbah uses the rule "ending should be like the beginning," that is, since we may suspend the laws of purity at the beginning of bringing the sacrifice if we have no alternative, so too, in the end, we can burn parts that have become impure. There is no such logic for Shabbat. On the other hand, Rav Huna disagrees with the "ending like the beginning" principle. Rather, he says that Shabbat can be abrogated in this case since communal sacrifices are freely brought on Shabbat, but we never totally dispense with the laws of purity.
