Bava Metzia 90 - Who Can Muzzle? One IS allowed to muzzle an animal that is suffering from diarrhea. The prohibition of muzzling concerns what's good for its body, not the anguish it feels from not being able to eat. Can a man say to a non-Jew, "Muzzle my cow and thresh with it?" In general, can a Jew ask a non-Jew to do something forbidden to a Jew? The answer is "No," based on the following ruling. If a Jew had his bull stolen and castrated, thus turning the bull into an ox, the Jew is penalized by having to sell the ox. Q.E.D. Talk to MosesAI about it
