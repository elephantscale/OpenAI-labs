Bava Kamma 76 - A Thief Dedicates the Stolen Animal to the Temple If one stole an ox or a sheep, then consecrated it to the Temple, and then slaughtered or sold it, he pays twofold payment for stealing, but doesn't pay the fourfold or fivefold. Why not? Granted that when he slaughters it, it's the property of the Temple, not of the original owner. But when he consecrates it, let this be equivalent to a sale of a stolen animal to the Temple - thus making him liable for a fourfold or fivefold payment? No! Consecration differs from a sale: after consecration the animal is still called "A sacrifice of so-and-so", not a "sacrifice of the Temple." Test your knowledge... Talk to MosesAI about it
