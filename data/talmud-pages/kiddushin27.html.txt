Kiddushin 27 - Acquiring Moveable Properties While acquiring a field, "by dint of" it one may also specify acquisition of movable properties, wherever they may be, in which case no additional act of acquisition is required. In the same way, one may combine the sale of land with the gifting of movables. The land may even be sold to one person, while the gift of movables goes to the other. In all these cases complete money payment must be made before the movables are acquired. "Devolving of oath" happens when the Torah requires an oath for one item and a related item requires an oath by devolving. Talk to MosesAI about it
