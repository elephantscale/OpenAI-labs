Avodah Zarah 43 - Ornaments that are Often Worshipped If one finds utensils with the figures that symbolize dominion, he should take them to the Dead Sea and cast them into the waters. The customarily worshipped figures are those of a crowned king seated in a chariot - representing the sun, a similar allegorical figure of a moon, or a dragon - which some interpret as a serpent. The highly saline waters of the Dead Sea are not navigated by men, and there is little risk of anyone recovering and enjoying them. Rabbi Yehudah adds an image of a nursing woman, which was worshipped because of Eve, who nursed the entire world. Rabbi Elazar HaKappar once found a ring with a dragon on it. He found an adult idolater and forced him to nullify the idol. We see from here that a Jew cannot nullify an idol, that an adult idol worshipper can nullify even an idol that is not his, and even under duress. All this refers to using a found object, but prohibitions for a Jew to create an image are stricter, and one has to avoid even a suspicion of idol worship.
