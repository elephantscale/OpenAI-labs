Megillah 30 - What happens when Purim is on Friday? If Purim happens on a Friday, when will we read the Torah portion of "Remember Amalek and what he did to you?" There is a direct connection between the two: on Purim they destroy Amalek (since Haman was a descendant of this archenemy of the Jews), and on Shabbat when they read about it, the people recall this commandment. Logically, one should read about Amalek first, and only then go to fight him. Therefore, they should read about Amalek on the Shabbat before Purim - and that is what Rav says. Shmuel, however, holds that they should read about Amalek in its proper time as it falls out. As far as events being out of order: first do, and then be commanded - Shmuel answers that since there are walled cities, who would celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of the month, for them at least it will come at the same time. The Talmud continues with the discussion of the multiple possible occurrences of calendar days and Shabbat, Holidays, and the Torah portions read on these occasions. Today, when the calendar is fixed and is not determined by the Court, many of these coincidental occurrences can not happen.
