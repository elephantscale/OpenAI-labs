Bava Metzia 76 - Hiring Craftsmen If one hires craftsmen and they deceived one another - they can only have grudges, but no monetary claims. For example, if one hired wagon drivers to delivery flutes for a bride or a funeral, or he hired them to do anything which, if not performed, would cause a loss and they reneged on their commitment and refused to work, then if he has to hire other workers at higher wages, they will have to pay the difference, or he can trick them into working for him. If they reneged on their commitment in mid-task, their wages are calculated in the way least favorable to them. Talk to MosesAI about it
