Megillah 4 - Why is the Megillah never read on Shabbat Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "Women, too, are included in the mitzvah of listening to the Megillah." Why? - Because they were included in the miracle of Purim. Some say, it means that they were in danger, and some - that the salvation came through them. The people living in villages used to hear the Megillah earlier than those living in cities. But what is a city? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "Any place that does not have ten men always present in the synagogue and learning Torah, and available for prayer - such place is not called a city." But it is a known rule; why repeat it? - To tell us that passers-by through the city don't count. We mentioned that the people who lived in villages can read the Megillah earlier, such as if they come to a city on the day of court assembly, Monday or Thursday. Who does this enactment benefit? Mainly, the people in the cities, because their brethren living in villages supply them with food and will be available for this on the day of Purim; but also partially benefits the villagers, for they won't have to make a second trip, having visited the city before. Why is the Megillah never read on Shabbat? All are obligated to hear it, but not all are experts in reading. Thus, one can take the scroll to the Sage on Shabbat to learn with him and, as a result, carry it in the public area, which is forbidden on Shabbat. It is also for the benefit of the poor people, who expect food and presents on Purim, and it would be harder to do this on Shabbat.
