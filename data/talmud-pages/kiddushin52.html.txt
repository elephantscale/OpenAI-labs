Kiddushin 52 - Betrothal with Stolen Goods From the previous teaching about a man who betrothed five women with a basket of figs, collected in the Sabbatical year, and belonging to the women, we can draw three conclusions: - One can betroth with the produce of the Sabbatical year, even though it is ownerless while it grows, because collecting this produce is allowed; - If one betroths with stolen goods, even if they are the bride's, the betrothal is invalid; - A woman can become an agent of betrothal for another woman, even where she also becomes a rival wife.
