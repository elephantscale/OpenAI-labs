Kiddushin 46 - A Woman who Ate her Betrothal Gift If one says to a woman: "Become betrothed to me with this date," then again "Become betrothed to me with this date"; if either one of these dates has the value of a prutah, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed. If he hands her the dates and says: "Become betrothed to me with this, with this, and with this," if there is the value of a prutah in all of them combined, she is betrothed. If she was eating the dates one by one, she is not betrothed unless one of them has the value of a prutah. Talk to MosesAI about it
