Bava Kamma 106 - One Who Swore Falsely May Not Have to Pay If one says to his fellow, "You have my maneh (100 zuz, or $5,000) in your possession," and the other responds, "I do not have anything of yours," - and he swears to that effect, and afterwards witnesses come and attest to his guilt, he is exempt from payment: "...and its owner shall accept it and he shall not pay..." teaches that once the owner has received an oath, the defendant no longer pays money. This is logical regarding a loan, which is given to the borrower to be spent, but it is true even in regards to deposit, because the quote is about a deposit. Talk to MosesAI about it
