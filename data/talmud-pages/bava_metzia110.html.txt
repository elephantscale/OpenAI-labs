Bava Metzia 110 - Timely Payment of a Hired Worker An employer is prohibited from delaying payment due to his employee: "...the wage of a hired worker shall not stay overnight with you until morning." and "On his day shall you pay his hire and the sun shall not set upon him...." One who is hired for the day and completes his work at evening collects his payment all night, that is, the entire night constitutes the payment time of the worker. One who is hired for the night collects all day, that is, the collection time for one who terminates his employment at day is that day.
