Kiddushin 61 - Conditions All stipulations (such as "I will marry you if you do this") must observe the following rules: * They must be doubled, such as if yes, then.. and if no, then ... * The stipulation must precede the act, that is, "If you do this, I will marry you..." * The positive must precede the negative This is learned from the conditions that Moshe set, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuven will cross..." and "But if they will not cross..." If these rules are not adhered to, the conditions are void. However, there are other opinions, and one better be careful. Talk to MosesAI about it
