Bava Kamma 8 - His Best Land or World's Best Land? When the courts assess land to determine which lands are considered "superior" for the payment of damages, do they asses in terms of the damager's own properties, or do they asses in terms of the properties of the world at large? This question is only relevant to Rabbi Akiva's opinion, because Rabbi Ishmael unambiguously stated that they assess in terms of the damaged party's lands. What is the answer? From a ruling about a damager possessing only average and inferior land, do we see that we assess relative to the world at large? No! He had superior land but sold it. Talk to MosesAI about it
