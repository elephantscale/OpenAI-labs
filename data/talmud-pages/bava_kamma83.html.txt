Bava Kamma 83 - Aspects of The Injury One who inflicts a wound on his fellow can be liable on account of him for "five things" - five aspects of the injury: * for actual damage; * for pain; * for healing; * for loss of employments; * and for humiliation. How do we asses actual damage? If the assailant blinded the victim's eye, cut off his hand, or broke his leg, we view the victim as if he were a servant being sold in the market, and we appraise how much he was worth before he was wounded and how much he is worth now.
