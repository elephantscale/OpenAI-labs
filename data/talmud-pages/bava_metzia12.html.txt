Bava Metzia 12 - To Whom the Finds Belong If an owner of a purse declared it ownerless, and then threw it through someone's house, so that it entered one door and exited through another, does the houseowner acquire the purse with the "courtyard" acquisition? - This was left unanswered. The find of one's dependent son or daughter, of one's Canaanite slave, male or female, and of one's wife - these belong to him, some from the Torah, and some by Rabbinical enactment. The find of one's independent son or daughter, of one's Hebrew servant or maidservant, and of one's wife whom he divorced, although he has not yet paid her Ketubah - these belong to them.
