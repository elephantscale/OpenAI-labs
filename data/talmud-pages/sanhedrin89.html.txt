Sanhedrin 89 - False Prophet The rebellious sage is executed by the High Court in Jerusalem, at the time of the next Festival, so that "the entire nation shall hear and fear and will not act willfully anymore" - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that they do not delay the judgment, but rather execute him immediately, and then write out proclamations and send messengers to all places. A false prophet is executed at the hands of man, but one who suppresses his prophecy, one who disregards the word of a prophet, or a prophet who transgresses his own words is subject to death at the hands of Heaven.
