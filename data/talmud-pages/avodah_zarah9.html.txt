Avodah Zarah 9 - How the Romans Vanquished the Greeks Kratesis is the third festival subject to a three-day commerce restriction, and it celebrated Rome seizing sovereignty. Actually, there were two victories, one in the time of Cleopatra, and before that, against the Greeks. The Romans fought thirty-two battles against the Greeks but were unable to overcome them, until they accepted Israel as a partner. They then sent a message to the Greeks: "Until now we were fighting with weapons, but now let's reason. If one has a carbuncle and a Torah scroll, which one should be made into a setting for the other?" The Greeks replied, "The carbuncle should be the setting for the Torah scroll." The Romans then replied, "If so, we have a Torah scroll with us, for Israel is with us." Then they went ahead and defeated the Greeks. The Romans promised to treat Israel as partners, but after twenty-six years, they subjugated Israel. What was their logic? At first they relied on "I will proceed alongside you," implying partnership between Esau (Rome) and Jacob. But later they expounded "Let my master go ahead of his servant," which indicates that Esau (Rome) is the leader.
