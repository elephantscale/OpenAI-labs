Bava Metzia 93 - Dealing in Food Entitlement The produce that the worker eats while harvesting is a charitable gift from Heaven, not a fringe benefit of his work, and therefore he can't assign it to his wife and children. A person may stipulate that he is not going to eat from harvested produce, in exchange for higher wages. He may also stipulate this for his adult children and his wife, since they have understanding, but not for his minor children or his animals. Of the four custodians, an unpaid custodian swears with regard to every mishap and is then not liable, the borrower pays for everything, and the paid custodian and the renter swear if an animal broke a limb, was captured, or died of natural causes.
