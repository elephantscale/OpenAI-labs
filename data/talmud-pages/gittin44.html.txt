Gittin 44 - Penalties Is one sells his slave to an idolater , the slave is freed as a penalty to his owner, because the slave will have to violate commandments. Same for selling the slave to outside of Israel, because of the precept against leaving Israel. If one fertilizes his field in the seventh year, then as a penalty he can not sow it next year; however, if he dies, his sons can sow that field. If an Israeli woman marries outside of Israel and brings slaves as her dowry, is this a sale and do the slaves go free? The question remains unresolved. Talk to MosesAI about it
