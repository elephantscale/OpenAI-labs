Ketubot 7 - Blessing at the wedding A marriage is a mitzvah that requires the following blessing to be said: Blessed are You, God our Lord, King of the universe, who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding not violating forbidden unions; Who forbade us to even stay alone with our bride before we are married, and Who permitted us those women who are married to us - but through proper chuppah, which is preceded by engagement. And then it concludes, just like a Kiddush - Blessed are You, God, Who sanctified Israel with chuppah and engagement. Art: The Engagement Ring by John Shirley Fox Talk to MosesAI about it
