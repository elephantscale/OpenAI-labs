Kiddushin 51 - Betrothal That Does Not Allow Cohabitation Concerning Kiddushin that does not allow legal cohabitation, Abaye said: It is a valid Kiddushin; Rava said: It is not a valid Kiddushin. Rava: "When a man shall take a wife and cohabit with her..." teaches my rule. Abaye: If a man betroths one of two sisters and does not know which, she is betrothed. However, since he does not know which of the two is his wife, he needs to give a Get to both. According to Rava, Kiddushin should not even take effect! Rava answers: The man knew whom he betrothed. Thus the Kiddushin took effect, and then they intermingled. This is the "K" in the six cases abbreviated Y A L K G M where the law follows Abaye against Rava.
