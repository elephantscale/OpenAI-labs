Yoma 79 - How much to eat on Yom Kippur? How much does one have to eat on Yom Kippur to be liable? - The volume of food equal to a large date. Rav Pappa wondered, "Date with the pit or without?" A similar question was asked by Rav Ashi about a human bone the size of a barley seed, which makes one ritually impure. Rav Ashi asked, "Dry seed or moist? With the shell or without?" Note that each of the Sages did not have any problem with the other one's question. Rav Ashi would tell you that "large date" implies as large as it can be, that is, with the seed. In turn, Rav Pappa would retort that a fresh barley seed has a different name, "shibboleth," and one with the shell is called "ushla." So the choice of the words itself in the rule already gives them the answer. And why specifically, a large date is used as a measure of prohibition for Yom Kippur? After all, it is less than an egg and is thus not considered a meal!? - The Sages estimated that this volume cools off the hungry person's mind, although it does not satisfy him completely.
