Sanhedrin 92 - The Resurrection of the Dead Of the many different sources in the Scripture, this one does not admit a figurative explanation, "And many of those who sleep in the dusty earth shall be awaken; these for everlasting life, and these for shame..." Said Rabbi Elazar, "If a person has understanding, it is as if the Temple were built in his days, for understanding is mentioned between the two names of God, and so is the Temple." Regarding the dead whom prophet Ezekiel resurrected, there many opinions: they stood on their feet, uttered a song, then died; it is a parable; they went to Israel, married wives and fathered sons and daughters, and Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira was one of their descendants. Regarding who they were, there are many opinions: that they were from the tribe of Ephraim, who left Egypt too early and were killed; they were people who denied the Resurrection of the Dead; these were people who covered the entire Temple with pictures of various idols.
