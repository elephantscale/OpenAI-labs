Menachot 25 - The Tzitz The tzitz was a golden head-plate worn by the High Priest on his forehead. It had the power to effect acceptance for an offering that became ritually impure. If the handful from a flour offering became ritually impure, and the kohen nevertheless offered it, the head-plate of the High Priest effects acceptance. However, this is only true for ritual impurity. If the handful was taken out of the Temple Courtyard and then brought back and offered, the head-plate does not effect acceptance, for the rule is that the tzitz effects acceptance for an offering that became disqualified due it its being impure, but not due to its having left the confines of the Courtyard. How do we know this rule? The Torah stated regarding the head-plate, "So that Aaron shall bear the sin of the sacred offerings." Now, which specific sin does it mean? About the intention to eat it in the wrong place the Torah already said "it will not be considered," and about the intention to eat it beyond allowed time, it said, "It will not be accepted." The only one left for the head-plate to correct is being ritually impure. Art: Eugene Carriere - Portrait Of A Priest Talk to MosesAI about it
