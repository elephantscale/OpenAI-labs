Bava Metzia 101 - Eviction Notice If one rents a house to his fellow, he cannot evict the tenant in the winter, i.e. from Succoth until Passover - unless he gives the tenant notice in the summer, at least thirty days before the beginning of Succoth, because during winter rental houses in Israel were hard to find. In large cities, where there is a perennial housing shortage, a landlord must give twelve months' notice before evicting a tenant. With regard to stores, both in the towns and in the large cities a landlord must give twelve months' notice, to allow the storeowners to start collecting on the credit they usually extend to their customers.
