Yoma 53 - How to burn incense Since the Torah said, "He shall take... the finely ground incense, bring it within the Curtain and place the incense upon the fire in front of God," we understand that he comes in with all the ingredients and then prepares the burning of the incense while already inside of Holy of Holies. This was not how everyone understood this phrase. The followers of Tsaddok said that the following words, "If he (the High Priest) comes in the cloud of smoke, then I (God) will appear to him there," - prove that the High Priest must come in with the incense already burning. What did the Sages answer? This phrase teaches not the sequence of actions but the composition of the incense - that there must be a special herb called "one that makes the smoke rise" included in the composition of the incense. What was the prayer of the High Priest before exiting? He said, "May it be Your will that the year be rainy and hot." - If so, how does it help? Rather, he meant that if it is destined to be hot, it may also be rainy. He also added, "May the prayer of wayfarers (who ask to stop the rain) not be permitted to enter in front of You." Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa was once on the road, the rain came upon him, and he said, "Master of the Universe, the whole world is happy, but Chanina is sad," - and the rain stopped. When he reached home, he said, "Master of the Universe, shall the whole world be in distress and Chanina in comfort?" - and the rain came again. Rav Yosef noted, "What good did the prayer of the High Priest accomplish against Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa?" Art: Rain By Camille Pissarro Talk to MosesAI about it
