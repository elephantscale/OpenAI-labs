Kiddushin 63 - The Father of the Bride Has a Say If a man says to a woman: "Become betrothed to me on condition that my father does not protest," and the father dies without protesting, the woman is betrothed. If the son dies, the father should protest, so that the woman avoids levirate marriage. If the father of a girl declared: "I gave my daughter in betrothal but I do not know to whom" and a man came and said "I am the one," he is believed. If two man came, both of them give a Get, and if they wish, one of them gives a Get and the other one marries her. Talk to MosesAI about it
