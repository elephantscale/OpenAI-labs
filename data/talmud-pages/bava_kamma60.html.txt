Bava Kamma 60 - The Owner of Fire Will Repay If one sends a fire in the hands of a deaf-mute, a deranged person or a minor, the sender is not liable under the laws of man but is liable under the laws of Heaven. If he sent fire in the hands of a mentally competent person, the sent one is liable. If one brought the fire and another brought the wood and put it in fire, the second one is liable. If another person fanned it, he is liable. If the wind fanned it, all are exempt. If one sends a fire and it consumes wood, stones or earth of another, he is liable. Talk to MosesAI about it
