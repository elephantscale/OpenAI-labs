Menachot 59 - No Oil and No Frankincense Some flour offerings require both oil and frankincense, some - only one of these, and some - neither oil nor frankincense. Normally, one mixes in oil and puts frankincense on top of the offering. This includes all fine-flour offerings brought as free-will offerings, those cooked on a griddle, in a pan, loaves, wafers, the daily offering of a High Priest, and the offering of a non-Jew. The flour offering of libations, brought together with an animal sacrifice, requires only oil. The Bread of vision requires only frankincense but no oil. The two loaves of Shavuot require neither oil nor frankincense, and the same is true of the sinner's offering and the offering of jealousies. If one did put oil on the offering of jealousies, he has invalidated it, but if he placed frankincense, it should be removed, and the offering is valid. Rabbah bar Rav Huna asked Rabbi Yochanan, what is the law if one put finely ground frankincense on the sinner's offering? The rule above said that frankincense should be removed, but this one is finely ground and cannot be removed. To this the answer was found: such offering becomes invalid.
