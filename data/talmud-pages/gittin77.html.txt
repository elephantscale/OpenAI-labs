Gittin 77 - He Throws Her the Get If someone throws a Get to his wife while she is inside her house or inside her courtyard, she is divorced, because her property has acquired the Get for her. If he threw the Get while she was inside his house, even if the Get is with her in the same bed, - she is not divorced, because the Get has not been placed in her domain. If he threw the Get into her lap or into her sewing basket hanging from her, she is divorced. Later authorities prohibited divorcing a wife without her consent. Talk to MosesAI about it
