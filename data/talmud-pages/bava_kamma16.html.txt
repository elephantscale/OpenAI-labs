Bava Kamma 16 - Usual and Unusual Damagers The final decision is that half-damages are a penalty. Thus if a dog killed and ate sheep or a cat killed and ate a chicken, it is a case of unusual damage, and it is not collected in court. This however only applies to large animals, but small animals are "tooth" damage and it can be collected. Five damagers are considered unusual and liable for only half-damage: domestic animal to gore, push, bite, squat, and kick. Among the five damagers considered normal, with their owners "warned" of the complete liability: animal while walking ("foot"), ox that already gored, and a man that does damage.
