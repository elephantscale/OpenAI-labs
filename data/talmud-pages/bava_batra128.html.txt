Bava Batra 128 - Decisions of Rabbi Abba Rabbi Abba sent a number of rulings to Rav Yosef. The last of them deals with inheritance. * If a defendant made an extralegal offer, like "Swear that this is your slave and take him" - he cannot retract. * A third-generation cousin can testify regarding a second-generation cousin. * One who knew a testimony about a land boundary, but became blind, cannot testify about it anymore. * If one says, "My wife shall take a share in my estate like one of my sons" - it is as he says. The husband certainly can give her a gift. However, she takes a share only in those properties that he owns now, not in any subsequent acquisitions.
