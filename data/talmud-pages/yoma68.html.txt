Yoma 68 - Waiting for the goat The High Priest returned to the ox and the goat. They were slaughtered earlier and will later to burned. He took out the sacrificial parts to be burned on the Altar, put them in a golden vessel, and braided the limbs of the two animals together. Other priests took them out to the burning place, carrying them on a pole and dismembering them before burning, not removing the skin. These priests became impure through performing this service. Now the High Priest had to wait until the goat would arrive at its destination, which was twelve "mil" (about eight miles) away. But how did they know that it was done? People would wave flags and see each other, one after the other, at each booth. Others say that he only had to go for three "mil," and that is where the rock was, and the time was estimated by his envoy returning and then walking for another "mil," thus walking for the total of three "mil." Rabbi Yishmael says that the red strip of wool would always become white once the goat reached the desert, and that is how they knew.
