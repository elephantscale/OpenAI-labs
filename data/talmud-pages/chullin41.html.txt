Chullin 41 - A Person Cannot Forbid Something That Is Not His If an idolater performed a libation with a Jew's wine, but did it not in front of an idol, then Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava say that the wine remains kosher, for two reasons: libations are normally done in front of an idol, and moreover, a person cannot forbid something that is not his. This point of view argues against what Rav Huna said about slaughter in front of idol. This opinion also argues against the concept of kosher wine. According to it, if a Jew owns the wine, it never becomes non-kosher, even if touched or processed by non-Jews. However, it does not become law, and it was not mentioned in the whole tractate of Avodah Zarah. One may not slaughter into a sea or into a river, because it may seem that he is slaughtering to the spirit of the sea or the river. One may slaughter into a pool of water, because blood mixed with water would never be used in idol worship. If one slaughters a regular animal in the name of some free-will offering, then people may confuse it with an actual offering, and the shechitah is declared non-kosher.
