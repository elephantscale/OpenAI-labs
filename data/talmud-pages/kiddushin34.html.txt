Kiddushin 34 - Women's Obligations to do Mitzvot Women are not obligated to do mitzvot which are related to time, such as dwelling in a succah or hearing the shofar, although they observe these as a custom. They are also not obligated to learn those areas of the Torah which have no practical applicability nowadays. Women are obligated to affix mezuzot to their doorposts, because for this the Torah promises long life, and women need long life just as men do. Women are obligated in all the negative commandments of Passover, such as not eating bread, and therefore all of the positive commandments of Passover, such as eating matzah. Talk to MosesAI about it
