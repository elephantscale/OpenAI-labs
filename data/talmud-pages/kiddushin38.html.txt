Kiddushin 38 - Moses, Manna, and the Land of Israel Moses said, "I am one hundred and twenty years old today." The extra word "today" teaches that God completes the years of the righteous ones. Moses was born and died on the 7th of Adar. When Moses died, manna ceased to descend from heaven, and the Jews subsisted on the manna which was left in their vessels until the next Passover, thus making up the complete 40 years of eating manna. From "...and you shall proclaim liberty in the land" one might think it is only in Israel, but the extra "this is the Jubilee year," teaches that slaves are released everywhere.
