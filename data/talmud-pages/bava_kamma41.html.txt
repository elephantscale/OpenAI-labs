Bava Kamma 41 - An Ox Kills a Man If an ox gored a person and he died, then if the ox was warned for goring, its owner pays redemption payment, and if it was innocent, he is exempt from redemption, but in both cases the ox is liable to death. The same law holds where the victim was a minor. If the ox gored a Canaanite slave or a maidservant, the ox is stoned, and the owner gives thirty sela (about $5,000) no matter whether the slave is worth a hundred times more or a hundred times less than this amount. Talk to MosesAI about it
