Yoma 88 - One should always forgive Rav was explaining Torah verses in the class of his teacher, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Every time a new student came in, he was forced to start from the beginning, out of respect for him. Finally, when Rabbi Chanina came in, Rav did not restart, and Rabbi Chanina was offended. For thirteen years, Rav came to ask forgiveness on the eve of Yom Kippur, but Rabbi Chanina was not appeased. How did Rav do it, seeing that one should not ask for forgiveness more than three times? - Rav went beyond the letter of the law. And how could Rabbi Chanina not forgive? We know that if one overlooks an insult and does not insist on his rights, then the Heavenly court overlooks his mistakes and the fact that he himself is unworthy? - Rabbi Chanina had a special reason: in a dream, he saw Rav hanging from a palm tree, and he knew that this meant that Rav was destined to become the head of the academy. This meant that he, Rabbi Chanina, who was the head of the academy in Israel, would have to die to vacate the post. Therefore, he pushed Rav to go to Babylonia, where Rav finally established his great academy, which existed for eight hundred years. If one has a seminal emission on Yom Kippur, his sins are forgiven. But we learned in another place, "his sins are arranged in front of him!?" - Arranged to be forgiven.
