Bava Batra 67 - One Sells an Olive Press The building of an olive press was generally made solely for that purpose. Hence, the sale of this building includes all non-movable items used in the pressing process. One who sells the house of an olive press without specifying what is included in the sale has sold the vat, the crusher (that is used to pre-soften olives), and the "maidens". These items are automatically sold with the press because they are attached to the building where the press is housed. However, he has not sold the boards, the wheel, or the beam. These items are excluded from sale because they are not attached to the building. If he said, "I am selling you the house of the olive press and all that is contained therein," he has sold all of these items - but not unrelated items that are merely being stored in the house.
