Bava Metzia 19 - How to Write a Will under the Torah Law Wills are not valid under Torah law; upon a person's death, all property passes to his natural heirs. One of the possible correct ways is to to stipulate that the gift takes effect "from today and after death." Under this clause, the gift is granted to its beneficiary in two stages: the property itself is granted immediately, the benefactor thereby relinquishing his right to transfer it to anyone else. However, the right to the property's yield (i.e. including such things as produce and rental income) is not granted to the beneficiary until the benefactor's death. Thus the benefactor continues to enjoy the use of his property for the reminder of his life. Test your knowledge of the daf Talk to MosesAI about it
