Niddah 50 - One but Not the Other - Judges and Charity Everyone who is fit to judge capital cases is certainly fit to judge monetary cases, but there are some who are fit to judge monetary cases, but not cases of life and death - and who is this? - a "mamzer", child born from an adulterous relationship. Everyone who is qualified to judge is qualified to testify, but there are some who are qualified to testify but not to judge. Who is they? - One who is blind in one eye - he cannot be a judge. However, this is only the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who derived it from the Torah's use of the word, "on the day" talking about the laws of money judgments and of spiritual leprosy: just as the leper must be examined with "the entire sight of the Kohen," so too the judge must have complete vision. Anything that is subject to tithing (that is, food), can also convey ritual impurity of food. However, there are types of food that convey impurity, but they are not subject to tithing, namely, meat, fish, and eggs - because they don't grow from the ground. Anything that is subject to pe'ah (leaving over the corners of a field for the poor) is also subject to tithing, but there are things that are subject to pe'ah but not to tithing, that is, figs and vegetables. Why not these? Because pe'ah is only left from food that is collected in one harvest (not figs) and that does not spoil when stored (not vegetables). Art: Vasily Perov - Blind Talk to MosesAI about it
