Kiddushin 15 - Hebrew Servant Can Marry a Non-Jewish Slave-Woman There are four categories of Hebrew servants discussed in the Torah: 1. A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts in order to pay the one he robbed; 2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father; 3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty; 4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile. A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave-woman in order to have children. Even today there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaanite slave-woman. Talk to MosesAI about it
