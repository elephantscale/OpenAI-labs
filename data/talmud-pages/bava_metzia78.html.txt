Bava Metzia 78 - Rental Agreements If one rents a donkey to lead it on a mountain and he led it in a valley instead, or vice versa, and the donkey dies on the way, the renter is liable. If one rents a donkey to lead it on a mountain and he led it in a valley instead, then if the animal slipped, the renter is not liable, since slipping is even more likely in the mountain. If the animal died of heat, he is liable, since the valley is a warm place surrounded by cool mountains. If the donkey was temporarily put into king's services, the renter waits for its return, but if it dies, the owner provides another donkey. Talk to MosesAI about it
