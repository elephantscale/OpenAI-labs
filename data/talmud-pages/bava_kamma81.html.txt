They include * people can pasture their animals in privately-owned forests and the owners shall not object; * they may gather wood from their fellows' fields; * they may gather grasses for animal feed from any place; * one may cut off shoots from another person's tree in order to plant or graft them; * all may fish with hooks and lines in the sea of Tiberias (Kinneret).
