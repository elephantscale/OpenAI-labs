Bava Kamma 101 - Thief Steals the Wool, Dyes It, and Returns It If one robbed wool and liquid dye belonging to someone, and dyed that wool with the dye, and now returns the dyed wool to the owner - is the improvement of dye considered something material? That is, when the thief returns the dyed wool to the owner, is he returning both the dye and the wool? Or, perhaps that improvement is not considered something material, and thus he is returning only the wool but not the dye - which has in effect disappeared? The question is relevant when the dyed wool became cheap. Does the thief have to pay for the dye? Talmud doesn't resolve the question. Talk to MosesAI about it
