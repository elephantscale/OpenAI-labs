Pesachim 66 - How Rabbi Akiva has set up Rabbi Eliezer When Passover eve - time to bring the Passover sacrifice - falls out on Shabbat, it is still permitted to bring this sacrifice even if this violates Shabbat laws. One can do the slaughter, throw the blood on the Altar walls, and remove the intestines and the waste. However, roasting the meat can and should be done after Shabbat. Likewise, such acts as carrying the sacrifice on one's shoulders to the Temple or bringing it from afar do not override Shabbat rules. Here Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and says that they do override Shabbat because, in his view, the love of the mitzvot tells us to violate Shabbat in preparing for a mitzvah that will be done on Shabbat. As Rabbi Eliezer got carried away defending his position, Rabbi Akiva prepared a trap for him. He constructed a logical argument that seemed to uproot the teachings of the Torah. He said, "Look at the mitzvah of purifying one for the Passover - it did not become permitted on Shabbat even though it was needed! So, Rabbi Eliezer, don't be surprised that the Torah did not allow the Passover sacrifice to be brought on Shabbat." Rabbi Eliezer fell for it and exclaimed, "Akiva! You are ruining what the Torah said! It told us to bring the sacrifice at the appointed time!" Now Rabbi Akiva countered, "Please show me where the Torah says the appointed time for those other acts that you allow." Art: Vendor of Roast Meat by Pietro Longhi Talk to MosesAI about it
