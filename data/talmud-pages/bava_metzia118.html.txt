Bava Metzia 118 - Two Gardens If there are two gardens one above the other, and vegetables are growing out of the vertical surface between them, to whom do the vegetables belong? Rabbi Meirs says, "They belong to the owner of the higher garden." Rabbi Yehudah says, "They belong to the owner of the lower garden." Rabbi Meir said, "If the owner of the upper garden wants to take his earth away, there would be no vegetables left!" Rabbi Yehudah said "If the owner of the lower garden wants to fill his garden with earth, there would be no vegetables there." Rabbi Shimon said, "Any vegetables that the owner of the higher garden can reach with his hand and take - belong to him. The other vegetables belong to the owner of the lower garden."
