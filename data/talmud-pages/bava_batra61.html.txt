Bava Batra 61 - When One Sells a House The following rulings were promulgated for the architectural styles, usages, and practices of those times. All such regulations depend on the prevailing custom in any given time or place. If one sells a house without specifying what is included in the sale, he has not sold the annex, even it opens into the house. Nor has he sold a storeroom in the rear of the house. Such closets served as a storage area for valuables and did not function as part of the living area of the house. Neither has he sold the rooftop if it has a parapet around it at least ten hand-breads high. Art: A lady in a garden by moonlight - by Atkinson Grimshaw Talk to MosesAI about it
