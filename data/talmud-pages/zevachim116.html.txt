Zevachim 116 - How to Bring Sacrifices on a Private Altar When private altars were allowed, one could bring any clean (kosher) animal: domesticated, wild, or a bird, provided that it was not missing a complete limb. This was still permitted to non-Jews after the Temple was built and the Jews had to bring their sacrifices there. Could the sacrifices brought on private altar be eaten as peace-offerings, or did they have to be burned, as burnt-offerings? Those who say that they could be eaten point out that "Abel brought from the firstlings of his flock and from their fats..." - that is, he brought the fats but ate the rest. And those who say that Abel brought only burnt-offerings explain that he brought the fattest of the lambs and burned them completely. But didn't Jethro bring peace-offerings? - Jethro came after the giving of the Torah, when eating sacrifices became allowed. What did Jethro hear that he came? He heard about the splitting of the Red Sea. But why did Rahav say about it "No spirit remained erect in any man" (hint)? - She knew, because there was no leader or ruler who did not come to her. She started at 10, was a prostitute for 40 years, and converted at 50. Art: Lovis (Franz Heinrich Louis) Corinth - The Painter Charlotte Berend With A Bull 1902 Talk to MosesAI about it
