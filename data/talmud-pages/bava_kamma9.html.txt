Bava Kamma 9 - Paying for Damages with Movable Items When the verse states "...he [the owner of the pit] shall return money..." , it means to include an article worth money as an acceptable form of payment, and even something such as bran. There are three ways to understand this: 1. One can pay with bran only if he has no money and no land; 2. One can pay with bran only if he doesn't have money; 3. One can pay with bran even if he has money, and if he has no money or movables left, then he needs to pay with superior land. Talk to MosesAI about it
