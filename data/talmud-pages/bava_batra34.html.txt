Bava Batra 34 - The Case of the Silver Ingot of Rav Abba A certain man snatched a silver ingot from his fellow. There was one witness to the snatching, but the defendant said, "Yes, I snatched it, but it was my ingot that I snatched!" Rabbi Ami considered the case: * Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses! * Exempt him based on "Why would he lie?" - he could deny having snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness. * Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did! * Make him swear that the ingot was his? We can't concoct oaths! Rav Abba offered a solution. The snatcher is obligated to take an oath but can not do so, and all such people must pay. Talk to MosesAI about it
