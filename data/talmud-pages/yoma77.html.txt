Yoma 77 - Crossing the river to see one's teacher To prove that abstaining from washing and anointing oneself is called an affliction, the Talmud quotes Daniel, who afflicted himself in this way. It then continues with these verses, which tell the story of the angel Gabriel being expelled from the Heavenly court but brought back "because of the words of Daniel." Daniel was shown in a vision that twenty-five people were standing in the Temple, bowing to the sun in the east, with their backs toward the Temple on the west. Since their faces were to the east, we already know that their backs were to the west; why is this mentioned? The real story was that they bared themselves and defecated toward the Temple as an additional sign of contempt. The Holy One Blessed be He said to the angel Michael, "Your nation has sinned!" Michael suggested to spare the nation because of the good ones among them, but the answer was, "I will burn them together with the good ones who did not protest." At this time, Gabriel asked another angel, a Cherub, to bring the coals, took those coals, and threw them on Jerusalem. However, since the coals cooled somewhat, the nation survived. They gave Gabriel sixty fiery lashes (pulsa d'nura) and expelled him. Gabriel continued arguing on behalf of the Jewish people, and when he mentioned Daniel, the Holy One Blessed be He asked, "Who is he that is advocating on behalf of my children?" - and Gabriel was brought back. As a result, however, Persians, and especially later Greeks, were given dominion. Even though washing is forbidden, if one wants to visit his father or his teacher on Yom Kippur, and a river separates them, he can cross even if the water reaches his neck. He is even allowed to go back since otherwise, he will refrain from going in the future. Only washing for pleasure is actually forbidden.
