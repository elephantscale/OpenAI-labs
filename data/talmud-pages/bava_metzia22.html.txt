Bava Metzia 22 - Despair without being Aware Consider the following ruling: "If a thief, who takes in secret, stole from one and gave to the other, the recipient may keep the goods. Similarly, if a robber, who robs openly, took from one and gave to the other, again the recipient may keep it. The case of a robber is understandable - the owner despairs of getting his things back, and the recipient thus acquires them. But in the case of a thief the owner is not aware of his loss!
