Zevachim 44 - Extending the Law of Rejection So far, we have assumed that the law of rejection applies to all sacrifices. However, how do we know that? The Torah only hints at this law, and even that only in the context of peace-offering. Here is the relevant passage, "If some of the meat-offering of his peace-offering will be consumed at all on the third day...it shall be rejected" and the person who eats it will be cut off from the people. We have already learned that this verse is talking about the intention to eat on the third day, not the real eating on the third day - since the meat becomes rejected right away, which can only happen as a result of his intention. However, how do we know that this law equally applies to other sacrifices, and not only to those that are similar to peace-offering, which would include just first-born and tithe? - From the extra word "of the meat" we learn that it applies to all sacrifices that are eaten. What about sacrifices that are not eaten, like the burnt-offering? - This is learned from the extra "offering" in the word combination "meat-offering."
