Megillah 27 - Selling a Torah scroll In general, one may only raise the sanctity of an object but not bring it down. Also, in general, the sanctity of the Torah scroll is the highest of all things. For example, if people sell a synagogue, they can use it only for items of greater sanctity, such as an arc in which the Torah scroll is stored. However, can one convert a synagogue into a study hall? In other words, is Torah study more important than prayer, or is prayer more important than Torah study? The Talmud finds the opinions that go in both directions. Each of them considers proof from the scriptures. Can one sell a Torah scroll to buy another one? Firstly, we should guard against negligence. The people might sell a scroll, set the money aside to buy a new one, and never come to buy the new one. But even aside from that, there is not a definite decision. However, one can sell a Torah scroll in two cases. The first one is to learn more Torah - because learning leads to actions, which are good deeds. And second is the purpose of marrying a woman because "He did not create the world to be void; He formed it to be inhabited."
