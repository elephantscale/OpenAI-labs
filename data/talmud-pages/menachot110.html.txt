Menachot 110 - Whether One Does Much or Little, but with a Pure Heart What does the verse in Malachi mean, "For from the rising of the sun to its setting My Name is great among the nations... all will sacrifice for My sake," for we see that this is not so? - This refers to those who study in every place on earth, whom God considers as if they serve Him and bring sacrifices. The verse continues, "and a pure flour offering" - this is talking about the one marries a wife and afterwards continues his studies. Why does it says in the Psalms, "Bless God, all you servants of God, who stand in the Temple of God in the nights," since we know that the main Temple service is during the day! - This refers to those who study at night, and they are considered as if they they were engaged in the Temple service. Why does the Torah say about every sacrifice, big or small, animal, bird, or flour, that it is a "pleasing sweet smell to God?" - to tell you that whether one does much or little, it is equally pleasing to God, if done with a pure heart.
