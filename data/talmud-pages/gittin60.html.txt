Gittin 60 - How was the Torah written down? When reading the Haftarah, it is better to read from a complete Tanach, rather than from a book containing haftarah selections, to show respect for the listeners. Was the Torah written on a complete scroll? No, it was written on separate scrolls, which Moshe connected together before his death. Proof? - "Then said I: Lo, I am come with the scroll of a book which is prescribed for me." Yes: Moshe remembered every section as it was taught, and then wrote them all before his death. Proof? - "Take this book of the law." Talk to MosesAI about it
