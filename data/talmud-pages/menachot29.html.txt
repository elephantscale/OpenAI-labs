Menachot 29 - Crowns on the Letters King Solomon "Made the ten Menorahs of closed gold... finishing gold". Why "finishing?" Because it finished off all "closed" gold that Solomon had. And what is "closed" gold? When this gold was sold, all other stores were closed. But Solomon had more gold!? - Not of "closed" gold quality. Solomon used a thousand talents for each Menorah, firing it in the kiln until it became purified to one talent. When Moses ascended to Heaven, he found God sitting and attaching crowns to letters of the Torah. Moses said, "Master of the Universe, what stops You from giving the Torah without crowns?" God replied, "There is one man, Rabbi Akiva, who will expound heaps of laws based on each crown." Moses was transported to the Academy of Rabbi Akiva, but could not understand his exposition, because Moses was used to know laws through revelation, without proofs. He became worried, but when Rabbi Akiva showed the students the Torah derivation rules he used, Moses' mind was at rest. "Give the Torah through him!" - said Moses to God. "No. Thus it came up in my thought," - said God. "Then show me his reward," - said Moses. God showed him how Rabbi Akiva was torn with iron combs and his body was sold in butcher shops. "This is the Torah and this is the reward?!" - said Moses. "Quiet! Thus it came up in my thought," - said God. Art: Theodule Augustine Ribot - The Torture of Alonso Cano Talk to MosesAI about it
