Zevachim 96 - Chip the glasses and crack the plates! Any vessel in which meat of the sacrifices was cooked requires purging - if the utensil is made of metal, and breaking, if it is made of earthenware. This is true regardless whether the meat was cooked directly in this pot, or if the broth was poured into it from another pot taken off the flame. Even though the Torah gives this requirement when talking about most holy offerings, such as a sin-offering, it is nevertheless true in regards to regular holy offerings, such as a peace-offering. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that regular holy offerings do not require purging or breaking of the pots. Rami bar Chama inquired, "If, when roasting a sin-offering, one suspended it in the airspace of an earthenware oven, does the oven require breaking or not? Was the Torah concerned about cooking and absorption, or even about cooking without absorption?" Can we find the answer in the above rule about broth? - No, we cannot! Broth is a case of absorption without cooking, and our question is about cooking without absorption. And what is the reason for breaking? - Because the absorbed flavor becomes prohibited "remains" in the morning. Art: Camille Pissarro - Eugene Murer at His Pastry Oven Talk to MosesAI about it
