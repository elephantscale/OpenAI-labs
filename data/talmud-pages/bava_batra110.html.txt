Bava Batra 110 - How Children and Brothers Inherit From where do we derive that the son precedes the daughter in the line of inheritance? From "...if a man dies... and he has no son, then you shall pass his estate to his daughter..." This implies that the reason the daughter would inherit is because the deceased has no son; but if he had a son, the son would precede her. Brothers inherit from each other and bequeath to each other - provided that they are brothers from the same father. Brothers related only through their mother are not connected for inheritance. This is derived from "...according to their families, according to their fathers' households..." Art: Edward Bird - A Family Portrait Talk to MosesAI about it
