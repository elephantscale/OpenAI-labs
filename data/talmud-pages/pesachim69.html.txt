Pesachim 69 - More meat for the Seder Since the Passover offering should be eaten in a kingly manner - in abundance and not in hunger - another offering to provide more meat was often brought. This other offering is called "chagigah," or the festival offering. However, this chagigah had more conditions attached to it than the Passover offering. The chagigah was brought only on the Passover that fell on a weekday, not on Shabbat. Chagigah was also not brought when there was enough of the Passover lamb anyway, such as few invitees in the group. The chagigah could be a sheep, a cow, a goat, male or female, and, unlike Passover, it could be eaten for two days and one night.
