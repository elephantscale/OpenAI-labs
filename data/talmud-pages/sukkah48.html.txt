Sukkah 48 - A quick repartee Earlier, we said that many mitzvot on Sukkot last for seven or even eight days. For example, rejoicing goes on for eight days, and it is expressed with thanksgiving prayers (Hallel), eating (ideally, sacrifices), and drinking. The source for this is the phrase, "And you will be only happy." There is a rule that the word "only" comes to emphasize something at the expense of the other. What is it? - The eighth night of the festival is included in the joy of the previous seven days. A certain heretic whose name was Sasson (rejoicing) said to Rabbi Abahu, "In the future, the Jewish nation will be drawing water for me." He quoted the phrase from Isaiah, "You will draw water with rejoicing (Sasson)." Rabbi Abahu answers, "If it said, for Sasson, you may be right. But since it says with Sasson, the skin of that person (you) will be made into a flask and be used for water drawing."
