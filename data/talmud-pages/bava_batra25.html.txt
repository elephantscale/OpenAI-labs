Bava Batra 25 - It is on the Damaged Party to Protect Itself One must distance animal carcasses, graves, and a tannery fifty amot (100 feet) from a town, so as not to disturb the town's residents with their foul order. One must distance a flax pool from vegetables and mustard seeds from the bees of his neighbor. Water from soaking flax is toxic to the vegetables. Bees digest mustard, and it causes the honey to become pungent. Alternatively, it causes the bees to consume the honey. Rabbi Yosi allows damaging agents to be put in one's property when the damage is indirect, like in the case of flax and mustard, putting on the damaged party the obligation to protect itself, and his view becomes law.
