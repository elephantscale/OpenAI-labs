Bava Kamma 109 - Son Robs His Father and Swears that He Didn't If one robs his father and swore falsely to him in denial of the robbery, and the father dies, and the son then admits his guilt - he pays the principal and the one-fifth surcharge (for false oath) to his father's other sons or to the father's brothers - who are the next in line to inherit. Although the robber is his father's heir, he may not keep that which he stole - for he must fulfill the dictate to return stolen property. If he doesn't wish or can't pay, he may borrow from others, repay, and his creditors will may then come and collect the debt from his inheritance. Talk to MosesAI about it
