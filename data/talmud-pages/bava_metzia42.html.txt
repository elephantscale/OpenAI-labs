Bava Metzia 42 - Negligence of Unpaid Custodian If one deposited money with another for safekeeping - who then either bundled it up in a kerchief and slung it behind him or gave it over to his young son or daughter, but did not adequately lock the door before them - the custodian is liable for loss and damage, because he did not guard the money in the normal manner of custodians.

The situation began with negligence but ended with an unavoidable mishap - and he is liable. Talk to MosesAI about it
