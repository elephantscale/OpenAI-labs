Kiddushin 60 - Betrothal with Delayed Payment If a man said to a woman: "Become betrothed to me after thirty days," and someone betrothed her in the interim, then when the thirtieth day arrives, second betrothal remains effective and thus prevents the first one from going into effect. If one says to a woman, "You are betrothed to me on condition that I will give you two hundred silver coins (about $10,000) - she is betrothed to him, provided that he pays. When he pays, she it betrothed to him retroactively from the first day. Therefore, if she accepted betrothal from someone else in the interim, it is void. Talk to MosesAI about it
