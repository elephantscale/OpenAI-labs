Sanhedrin 7 - Common Wisdom and Torah Rav Huna said, "Discord is comparable to a channel from an overflowing river - once it starts, it will continue to widen" - as in Proverbs, "The opening of a channel is a beginning of a discord." Abaye Kashisha said, "Discord is like a plank in a bridge: once people walk on it, it becomes firm and stays firm." One man liked to say, "Fortunate is one who hears his denigration without responding. A hundred misfortunes will pass him by." Said Rav Yehudah, "beginning of discord (ראשית מדון)" can be translated as beginning of a hundred misfortunes (ריש מאה דיני). One man liked to say, "When our love was strong, we could have lain together on the width of a sword, but now a bed of sixty amot (100 feet) does not suffice for us." Said Rav Huna - and so it is with God, at first it was "...and I will meet you (Moses) there and speak to you..." from above the ten hand-breadth Ark, but later about the Temple built by Solomon "...Says God - what house can you build for me?"
