Taanit 2 - Three keys In the prayer, there is a place to mention the power of God to give rain, and there is also another place to actually ask for rain. When should one say these? Rabbi Eliezer says that one should mention rain from the beginning of Sukkot, which marks the beginning of the rainy season. Rabbi Yehoshua asked, "A rain is bad on Sukkot, because one is trying to live in a sukkah!?" Rather, one should begin to pray for rain on the last day of Sukkot. Rabbi Eliezer answered, "I also did not mean to pray for rain on Sukkot, just to mention God's power to give it." Rabbi Yehoshua asked, "Then mention it all year!" Rabbi Eliezer replied, "Actually, yes, you can." Good answer! And Rabbi Yehoshua? He replied, "I understand why we mention the Resurrection of the Dead because any day is good for that. On the other hand, rains are bad at harvest time and so should not be mentioned." Why does the teacher start this subject at all?! - Since we just learned about Rosh Hashanah, where it is discussed when the world is judged regarding water and rain, it is now appropriate to discuss when to pray for it. But how do we know we should pray for rain? - Because of the phrase, "You will serve God with your heart... and He will give you rain." What is the service with the heart? - that is prayer. Why does the teacher mention specifically the "power" of God to give rain? - because, as Rabbi Yochanan said, it is related to one of the three keys that God does not give to another: rain, conception, and the revival of the dead.
