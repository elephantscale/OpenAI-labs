Zevachim 108 - Stringencies of Slaughtering and of Offering Up a Sacrifice Outside There are ways in which slaughtering a sacrifice outside the Temple is more stringent, and there are other ways in which offering it up (burning) are more stringent. If one takes an animal that was consecrated as a sacrifice and slaughters it for someone's consumption, he is liable to slaughtering outside. If, however, he offers it up for someone, he is not liable for offering up a sacrifice outside the Temple, because he did not dedicate it to God. In truth, he is liable for idol worship for worshiping that human, but that is a different liability. Offering up is more stringent in this way: if two people held a knife together and slaughtered a sacrifice outside the Temple, they are not liable, but if they took a sacrificial limb and offered it up, they are liable. If one offered a limb of a sacrifice, then became aware that it was prohibited, then forgot it, then offered another limb, again became aware and again forgot it, and so on, he is liable for each limb - so says Rabbi Shimon, but Rabbi Yose makes him liable just once.
