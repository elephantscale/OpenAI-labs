Gittin 43 - A woman who is half-slave, half-free If a master sells his slave only for the right to collect penalty payment in the event the slave is killed by an ox, is the sale valid? Since there is a law about the rights of a slave whose value is zero, the sale must be invalid, because any slave should have at least this value? Rebuttal: no, if the slave is mortally ill, there is no penalty for goring. Result: answer is unknown. If one engages a half-slave, half-free woman, she is engaged, but if one engages half of a free woman, she is not engaged. Talk to MosesAI about it
