Yoma 64 - Can live sacrifice be rejected? Earlier, we learned about a situation where one of the two goats dies. The solution was to bring another pair of goats and draw new lots while making a stipulation. The stipulation was complex and would end with a phrase, "and the other one will go to graze." Who was "the other one?" The compiler of the Mishna left it unclear, and he did it on purpose. There was a disagreement on this point, and he formulated it in such a way as to leave both of the disputants happy. This disagreement is enunciated: Rav says it is the second goat of the second pair, and Rabbi Yochanan says it is the second goat of the first pair. The key point here is whether a live sacrifice can be rejected. Rav says that the remaining live goat of the first pair is rejected, but this is not forever, and as soon as another goat is added, it becomes acceptable again. Rabbi Yochanan says that once an offering is rejected, it is forever rejected and cannot be used. The proper place for this argument is in the part of the Talmud dealing exclusively with sacrifices, and that is where it can be found in detail.
