Bava Metzia 92 - How Much Can a Worker Eat? A worker may eat a cucumber (cucumbers were expensive vegetables) or a date (which were expensive fruit) even if worth a dinar (six times his wage). The Torah tells the worker "...you may eat grapes as is your desire, to your satiety..." which implies that he may eat any amount needed to satisfy his hunger. Rabbi Elazar Chisma says that a worker may not eat more than his wage. But the Sages permit this - however, his friends should teach him not be a glutton and thereby close the door to future employment. Talk to MosesAI about it
