Bava Kamma 42 - Can't Benefit From This Ox "If an ox shall gore a man or a woman and he shall die, the ox shall surely be stoned; its flesh may not be eaten and the owner of the ox shall be innocent." Since "... the ox shall surely be stoned..." means that it died without proper slaughtering and is forbidden for consumption, then "...its flesh may not be eaten..." teaches that even if the owner slaughtered it, its meat is still forbidden. And "...the owner of the ox shall be innocent (clean)..." teaches that he can't sell it, as people say, "so-and-so has gone out clean of his possessions." Talk to MosesAI about it
