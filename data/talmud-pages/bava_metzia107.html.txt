Bava Metzia 107 - Natural Events vs. Luck If a tenant-farmer leased a field from his fellow, and the crop was blasted by the wind which reduced its quality, he may pay his rental out of this crop.

Rav once went to a cemetery and used an incantation to discover how every person there died, and he stated that ninety-nine out of a hundred died from an evil eye, and only one from natural causes. Rav Chanina said that everything is in the hand of Heaven except for cold drafts. In the future, God will remove all illnesses, even the ones mentioned. Talk to MosesAI about it
