Nazir 61 - Who can become a nazir? A Jewish man can become a nazir, but a non-Jew cannot. Also, a Jewish woman can become a nazir (nazirah), and one can even force his slave to become a nazir. All three rules above are not obvious. Why is it that a non-Jew cannot become a nazir? - Because the Torah said, "Speak to the sons of Israel," but not to other peoples. However, this cannot serve as proof because later, the Torah uses the term "man," which should mean "any man." In fact, a non-Jew can bring sacrifices in the Temple, so why can't he be a nazir? Perhaps it is because a nazir is not allowed to bury even his father, and maybe for a non-Jew, it is different? - Can't be because inheritance laws apply to all people, including inheriting from the father. Or perhaps it is because a nazir should avoid impurity, and a non-Jew, since he does not go to the Temple and does not have the concept of impurity, cannot be a nazir? - No, that is not convincing either: perhaps he does have a concept of impurity, just that he gets no punishment for being impure!? The Talmud tries a few more attempts but concludes that this rule is impossible to prove. Rabbi Yochanan summarized that God tells this law directly to Moses and not written anywhere in the Torah.
