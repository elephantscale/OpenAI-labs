Kiddushin 37 - Mitzvot Done in the Land of Israel and Outside Every commandment that is dependent on the land applies only in the Land of Israel, and every commandment that is not dependent on the land applies both in the Land of Israel and outside the Land, except for the commandments of Orlah (prohibiting first 3 years of tree's fruit) and forbidden mixtures of planting.
