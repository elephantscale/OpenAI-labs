Bava Kamma 32 - Running Before Shabbat If two people were walking in the public thoroughfare, one was running, and one was walking, or both were running, and they did damage to one another, both are not liable to pay damages. Said Rabbi Yochanan, - this ruling is only talking about the time right before Shabbat, when running for the sake of Shabbat is allowed, but otherwise the one who runs is liable. If one chops wood in the public domain and thereby does damage in the private domain; chops in the private domain and damages in the public; or chops in private and damages in private, he is liable for full damages. Talk to MosesAI about it
