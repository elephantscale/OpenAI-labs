Menachot 97 - Table for the Breads of Vision The table for the breads of vision had two rows, with six compartments each, one above the other, housing the twelve breads. The table was stationary, never carried around, and because of this should not be susceptible to spiritual impurity - except that every holiday the priests took the table and showed it to the pilgrims, to demonstrate that the bread was fresh and warm after a week, just as when it was baked. This is based on the phrase in Samuel, "To place bread that is hot on the day it is taken off." There were four props of gold on the table and twenty-eight rods, each like half a hollow reed, to separate the breads from one another, in order that they would not become moldy. This is based on the phrase in the Torah, "For [the table] make bread forms,incense bowls, and side frames, as well as the half tubes that will serve as dividers [between the loaves of bread]. All these shall be made of pure gold." Art: Nicolaes Gillis - Laid Table 1611 Talk to MosesAI about it
