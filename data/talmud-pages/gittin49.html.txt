Gittin 49 - Money obligations If a person or property was damaged, payments are collected from the best land of the liable party - so that people should not be negligent. Money and readily-sold personalty, if available, are first choice. Creditors collect their payments from the medium quality land - so that people would not refrain from making loans. However, since money was loaned, if the borrower has money, he pays that. Ketubah payments are collected from the inferior land, in order to prevent women who unscrupulously marry in order to provoke divorce and collect their ketubah dowers. These measures are for the benefit of society. Art: Le prÃªteur et sa femme (The money lender and his wife) by Quentin METSYS Talk to MosesAI about it
