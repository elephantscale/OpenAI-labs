Bava Kamma 114 - Objects That The Owners Despaired to Retrieve If (illegitimate) customs collectors confiscated someone's donkey, but then out of compassion gave him an inferior one, or if bandits confiscated his garment and gave him another garment, they are his, because it may be assumed that their owners have despaired of retrieving them. However, if out of piety he wants to returns these, he can return them to the original owners, and not the robbers. In the case of one who rescues things from a river, or from bandits, if it is known that the owners have despaired of retrieving them, they are his. Talk to MosesAI about it
