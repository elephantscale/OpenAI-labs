Bava Metzia 16 - When the Found Loan Document IS Returned If one finds a loan document that is certified in court, he should return it to the creditor. Usually it is the creditor who certifies the note. If the borrower had repaid the money, he should have ripped the document right there, and if he didn't do so, he brought undue loss on himself. According to the letter of the law, the land, once repossessed, need not be returned to the debtor when he wants to repay his loan. And it is only because of "You shall do that which is fair and good in the eyes of God" that the Sages said that the land must be returned. Test your knowledge of the daf Talk to MosesAI about it
