Bava Kamma 65 - How Much is the Thief to Pay? A thief pays the principal according to the value of the stolen article when he stole it; and he pays the twofold payment, fourfold and fivefold payments according to the value of the stolen article at the time that he is sued in court. If, however, the stolen article is still in the thief's possession in its original state, he returns the article itself as is. If an unpaid custodian claimed that a deposit he was safekeeping was stolen, and swore to that effect, but then admitted the fact that he took the item for himself, he pays the principal, adds one-fifth, and brings a guilt offering.
