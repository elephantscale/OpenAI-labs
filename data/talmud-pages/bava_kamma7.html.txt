Bava Kamma 7 - Whose Best Land? The damager is liable to make payments for the damage from the choicest of his land, based on this passage. Whose best land is it? Rabbi Ishmael says: "The damaged party's choicest field, or the damaged party's choicest vineyard." Why? Just as another man's field (mentioned before) was that of the damaged party, so too the payment is measured by the quality of the damaged party's land. And Rabbi Akiba says: "'...he shall pay his choicest field...'" clearly means - with the choicest field of the one who is paying." Money or valuables are also acceptable. Talk to MosesAI about it
