Bava Kamma 61 - Distance For Fire, Hidden Utensils If one lights a fire within his own property, how far should it be from the property of the nearest neighbor in order not to be liable? * Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria: about 400 feet; * Rabbi Eliezer: about 50 feet, like a public road; * Rabbi Akiva: about 150 feet; * Rabbi Shimon (accepted ruling): "...the one who ignited the fire shall pay..." - all depends on the fire's size. If one sets fire to a stack of grain and utensils were hidden in it and they were burned * Rabbi Yehudah: he pays for what was inside; * Sages: he pays only for the stack. Talk to MosesAI about it
