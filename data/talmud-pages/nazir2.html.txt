Nazir 2 - What is a nazir? A nazir is a person who makes a vow which includes abstaining from wine, cutting his hair, or coming into contact with a human course. It is wrong to become a nazir as self-punishment. Instead, if one chooses to become a nazir, it should be for self-improvement, and such a one is called "Holy to God." To become a nazir, one must make a declaration to this effect and entirely mean in. One does not become a nazir by mistake. If he changes his wording, and instead of "nazir," says, for example, "nazik" - since this was a common form these days - he would also become a nazir. Finally, if one makes an incomplete statement, such as "I will become..." and does not conclude, but there is enough evidence to what he really means, for example, by a nazir passing by and him pointing at this nazir - this is also effective.
