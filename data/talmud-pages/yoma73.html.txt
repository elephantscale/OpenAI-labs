Yoma 73 - Urim VeTumim The same eight garments of the High Priest discussed so far were also needed when consulting Urim VeTumim. Incidentally, the Kohen appointed for battle would go with the Jews to war and wear the same eight garments. After the war, he continued to serve in the Temple in the same outfit. Others say that he does not serve in the Temple at all. We cannot permit him to be like the High Priest because the real High Priest will feel bad about it. Neither can he wear the garments of a regular Kohen because they only raise in the level of holiness but never bring down. Back to Urim VeTumim, what was it? Some say that inside the High Priest's breastplate, they put a piece of parchment with the name of God written on it, others - that it refers to the precious stones on the breastplate. The High Priest would be wearing it, the king would ask a question, and the answer would be formed by the letters protruding forward. Some say that only a worthy High Priest could see them protrude and then interpreted the answer. Art: To Decide the Question By John George Brown Talk to MosesAI about it
