Kiddushin 65 - Disagreement about Who Betrothed Whom If a man says to a woman: "I betrothed you," and she says: "You did not betroth me," - he is forbidden to marry her relatives (mother, sister, etc.), but she is permitted to marry his relatives. If he says: "I betrothed you," and she says: "You did not betroth me, but rather you betrothed my daughter," - he is forbidden to marry the relatives of the mother, and the mother is permitted to marry his relatives; he is permitted to marry the relatives of the daughter, and the daughter is permitted to marry his relatives.
