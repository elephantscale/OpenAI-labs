Kiddushin 8 - Betrothal with Valuables A man betrothed a woman by giving her a quantity of silk. He said, "Become betrothed to me with $2,000, and here is this silk as payment." The silk was indeed worth $2,000. Does the woman, who is not an expert in appraisal, rely on his words and wholeheartedly commit herself in marriage? The prevailing ruling is that she does. If a man said to a woman, "Become betrothed to me with $100," but instead gave her an item as collateral, she is not betrothed. She did not receive the promised money, nor was collateral given as a gift. Talk to MosesAI about it
