Sotah 42 - Kohen at war A Kohen is appointed and anointed to go to war with the army. When the army approaches the enemy, he talks to the soldiers and says the following words, speaking in Hebrew. How do we know that he is talking in Hebrew? Because of the term, "he will say (vediber)." The same word describes Moses, "and Moses said, and God replied with a voice." Since Moses spoke to God in Hebrew, the Kohen at war also spoke in Hebrew. He says, "Listen, Israel (Shema, Israel!), you are approaching an enemy." He uses the word "enemy" to emphasize that if Jews were fighting against Jews, as it happened between the tribes at times, they could expect the victors to be merciful with the captives. He then quotes historical episodes to prove the point. However, with enemies, it is not like that; they will not pity you. This understanding caused them to fight with all their might. "They come against you with human might, as Goliath. You, however, will win, like David did, because your God is walking with you." Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said, "Why is God walking with them? - because they say the 'Shema' prayer, just like the Kohen at war mentioned. From here, we see that if only all Israel said 'Shema' in the evening and in the morning, they would never fall into the hands of the enemies."
