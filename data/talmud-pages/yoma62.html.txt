Yoma 62 - The two goats The two goats used for the Yom Kippur service should be alike in appearance, height, and value, and they should be bought together. If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, they are still valid for service. If one of them died, then if it died before the High Priest drew the lots, they simply buy another one. However, if it dies after the lot was drawn, they bring a completely new pair and draw new lots. Now, since the first one was already consecrated, the High Priest stipulates as follows. If the one designated for God died, he says that the new goat designated for God will take its place, but the second one in the newly brought pair will not be needed, so it will go to graze until it dies of old age. Conversely, if the one designated for Azazel died, then the new one on which the lot for Azazel falls will be in his place, and the other one will go to graze. Rabbi Yehudah adds that if the blood of the goat "for God" was spilled, then the one for Azazel cannot be used. And if the one for Azazel dies, then the blood of the one "for God" should be spilled away. We understand the first rule: if the blood is spilled, the mitzvah is not finished and therefore not done at all, so the service cannot proceed. But if one for Azazel dies - well, it was going to be sent to death anyway!? Rabbi Yehudah's view is based on a verse, "It should stand alive in front of God to atone," which means that it should be alive until the service of the other is complete.
