Bava Kamma 94 - Repentant Robbers and Bankers Robbers and lenders on interest who wish to return their illegally acquired monies to their victims - their victims should not accept the proffered monies from them, and if one does accept it form them, a spirit of wisdom and piety does not reside in him. This enactment was promulgated by the court of Rabbi Yehudah The Prince, to make it easier to repent for those who want to do it. It applies only to long-term transgressors, who can't return all money. Still, they need to try to return the money, to fulfill their Biblical obligation. It is a disagreement whether this enactment applies nowadays. Talk to MosesAI about it
