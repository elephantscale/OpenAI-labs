Sanhedrin 84 - Who is Strangled The complete procedure for strangulation was described earlier. The following are executed by strangulation: one who strikes his father or his mother and inflicts a wound; one who kidnaps a Jewish person, works him, then sells him as a slave; a sage who rebels against the word of the High Court; a false prophet; one who prophesies in the name of a false god; one who commits adultery; false witnesses against a daughter of a Kohen; and a man who illicitly cohabited with the daughter of a Kohen. Even though the witnesses have tried to impose the punishment of burning on the daughter of a Kohen, when they are disqualified as false witnesses, they receive the punishment appropriate for the adulterer, and not the adulteress, because of "...as he conspired to do to his brother."
