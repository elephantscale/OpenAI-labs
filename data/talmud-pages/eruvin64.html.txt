Eruvin 64 - Nice law Earlier we said that one who does not accept the law of the eruv ruins it for the other residents of the courtyard, making it prohibited for them to carry things in their own courtyard on Shabbat. However, there is a loophole: one can rent this person's rights in the courtyard, and even from his servant. One can also become friendly with the person, do him some service, and be considered his servant for this. On hearing this rule, Rav Nachman said, "How nice is it!" However, on hearing another rule, that one who drank wine (even 2-3 ounces) cannot render legal decisions, he said, "This is not nice. I, for one, cannot judge until I clear my mind with wine." However, Rava quoted to him, "One who sees prostitutes will lose his wealth." The word "prostitutes," "zonot" in Hebrew, can be understood as "zo nae", which means "this one is nice," so allegorically one he says "this law is nice, this one is not" will lose his learning. Rav Nachman said, "I am convinced and change my mind ." Art: A seated Peasant drinking in an Interior by Dutch School Talk to MosesAI about it
