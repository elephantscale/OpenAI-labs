Bava Batra 112 - Not to Transfer Land in Israel Between Tribes A man inherits his wife, but she does not inherit him. In discussing the laws of inheritance, it says "...and you shall give his inheritance to â€¦ his flesh and he shall inherit her..." and "his flesh" means his wife, because "...they shall become one flesh..." In connection with this, there was a commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe. The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the Land of Israel. It was applicable only to a woman who could potentially inherit land at the time of marriage - that is, if she had no brothers and was thus her father's prospective heir.
