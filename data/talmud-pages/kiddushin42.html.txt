Kiddushin 42 - Division of an Inheritance When orphans who are minors come before the court to divide the assets of their deceased father, the court appoints an administrator for each of them, just as leaders of the tribes divided the land between the Jews entering Israel. When the orphans become adults, they cannot protest the settlement, for if they indeed had such a right, what worth is there in the power of the court? Brothers who divide an inheritance are like purchasers of their respective shares. Consequently, if they erred estimating the value and the discrepancy is more than a sixth, the transaction is void.
