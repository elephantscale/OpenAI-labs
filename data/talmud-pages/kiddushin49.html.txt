Kiddushin 49 - Betrothal with a Wrong Object If a man says to a woman: "Become betrothed to me with this cup of wine," and the cup was found to contain honey, or the other way around - she is not betrothed. Some people prefer wine, and some prefer honey. Or, if a man asks a woman to become betrothed with a silver coin, and it was found to be made of gold, or the other way around - she is not betrothed. In some situations, she may need silver and in some gold. Rabbi Shimon says that if he promised a silver coin but gave a golden one, she is betrothed, since he only mentioned silver "by way of example." Ten measures of conversation descended to the world, and women took nine of them. Talk to MosesAI about it
