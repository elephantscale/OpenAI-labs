Pesachim 39 - Bitter herbs Together with the Passover lamb at the Seder, one must eat bitter herbs.

The quality of lettuce being sweet at first and bitter later reminds us how Egyptians treated the Jews: with soft talk first, but harsh actions later.

The bitter vegetable must not be boiled or pickled because this takes away the bitterness. Art: The Bitter Draught by Adriaen Brouwer Talk to MosesAI about it
