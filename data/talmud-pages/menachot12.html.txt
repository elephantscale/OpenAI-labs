Menachot 12 - Wrong Intentions for a Flour Offering If a priest took off a handful of flour with the intention to eat its remnants outside, or even an olive's volume of its remnants outside, or he wanted to burn it or its frankincense outside the Courtyard, the offering becomes invalid. These were all intentions for a wrong place. However, if he wanted to eat the remnants the next day, or burn the handful the next day, or perform any other services at the wrong time, then not only the offering becomes invalid, but one who eats it qualifies for being cut off from the people - provided that the rest of the service is done right. If one intended to eat half of an olive's volume of the remnants the next day and to burn half of the handful the next day - the offering remains valid, because the wrong intention to eat and the wrong intention to burn do not combine.
