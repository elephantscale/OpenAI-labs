Bava Kamma 10 - An Animal Falls into the Pit What is the case where one causes a portion of the damage but is liable for the complete damage? It is this case of a pit: When an animal falls into the pit and dies, if the pit is at least 10 hand-breadths deep, the owner of the pit is liable. If one person digs the 9 hand-breadths and the second one adds 1 hand-breadth, the second one is liable for all the damage, since he added the lethal quality to the pit. The owner of the pit pays the difference between the animal's worth while alive and the carcass' value. Talk to MosesAI about it
