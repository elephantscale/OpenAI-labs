Temurah 15 - Sin Offerings That Are Not Needed Continuing with differences between personal and communal offerings, there are personal sin offerings that, unfortunately, are left to die. However, this never happens with communal offerings. What are these personal sin-offerings? There are five types: offspring of a sin-offering, exchange of another sin-offering, a sin-offering whose owners died and are thus no longer in need of atonement, one whose owners used another sin-offering for their atonement (which can happen when the first offering is temporarily lost), and one that became older than a year. This law is known as one that, instead of logic, is based on a teaching passed from Moses through successive generations. However, Rabbi Yehudah argues and says that he possesses a more authentic version of the rule, according to which even communal offering in the same situation also has to die. Rabbi Shimon is known to give reasons for the rules of the Torah. He says that communal offerings need not die, and it can be proven by logic: for example, the sin-offering whose owners died, is not needed and therefore cannot be used. However, this is not applicable to the Community of Israel, which does not die. Art: Aleksander Kotsis - Mother Died Talk to MosesAI about it
