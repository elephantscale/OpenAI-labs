Kiddushin 81 - Don't Scoff at Sinners Rabbi Akiva was accustomed to scoff at sinners because he felt that it is a simple matter to overcome the temptations of the Evil Inclination if only one desires to do so. One day Satan appeared to him disguised as a woman, perched atop a palm tree. Rabbi Akiva began to climb to meet "her." When he reached the middle, Satan released him from his grip and said: "Had they not proclaimed in Heaven - 'Be cautious of Rabbi Akiva and his Torah,' - I would have made your life worthless." Students of Shmuel were careful not to be alone with an animal, but this is normally not required. Art: Ridolfo Ghirlandaio - Adoration Of The Shepherds Talk to MosesAI about it
