Bava Kamma 23 - Fire Damages If a person lit a fire in his field and the fire spread, that person is liable. Is that fire his "property," and he is liable only for the damages, or is it "arrows" - his own force, and he is liable also for pain, healing, and unemployment? It is "arrows." A cow is only liable for eating someone else's fruit if it veered into this someone's field. The owner of the cow could try to claim that the cow's mouth is his premises, and "what is your fruit doing in my cow's mouth?", but the above case of a dog that ate a biscuit precludes this. Talk to MosesAI about it
