Pesachim 95 - Compare first and second Passover The second Passover is one's second chance. It happens a month after the Passover, and its laws are somewhat relaxed. On the first Passover, he cannot eat chametz, cannot own it, and cannot benefit from it. On the second one, one can happily own both chametz and matzah at the same time. There is also a difference in prayer: the first Passover celebrates the miracle, and one recites the Hallel as giving thanks. But on the second one, it is a chance to make it up, not a celebration of what happened earlier. Surely, they say the Hallel while bringing the sacrifice on both occasions. The cooking instructions on the second Passover are the same: the meat is roasted and is eaten with matzah and better herbs. Here too, the sacrifice is brought even on Shabbat.
