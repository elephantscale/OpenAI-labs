Megillah 28 - A synagogue in ruins A synagogue that has fallen into ruin and is not used for prayer nevertheless retains its sanctity. One may not eulogize ordinary people there (unless Sages are present, making it a public eulogy). One may not work there, such as making ropes or nets or spreading fruit on its roof. One should also not use the synagogue as a shortcut. Why is this? - Because of the phrase, "And I will make your sanctuaries desolate." Thus, even after desolate, they are still called "your sanctuaries" and retain their rights. If grass sprouts there, one should not uproot it - to inspire grief. Since one cannot enter the synagogue for personal affairs, what is he to do when calling someone out of it? - He should come in and sit down. Then, if he knows certain portions of the Talmud or the Torah, he should recite them. If not, he can ask a child to repeat for him what the child learned today. Thus, he has converted his visit from personal to one for study or for prayer. Art: The Ruins of Taormina by Thomas Cole Talk to MosesAI about it
