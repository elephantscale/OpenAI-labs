Brachot 39 - A whole loaf or slices of better quality Two students were sitting at a meal in front of Bar Kappara. They brought before them cooked cabbage and partridge meat. Bar Kappara gave permission to one of the to say the blessing; the student rushed and said the blessing on the partridge, and his colleague mocked him. Bar Kappara became angry and said, "I am not angry with the one who said the blessing, but with the one who mocked. If you friend looks like one who never tasted meat in his life, is that a reason to mock?" Then he said, "I am not angry with the one who mocked, but with the one who wrongly recited the blessing. Even if I am not wise, at least I am older, and he should have asked." Both students did not live out the year. What was their argument? Could it be that one thought that cooked cabbage looses its special blessing, and then meat takes precedence, while one who mocked held that cabbage keeps its special blessing, and should be blessed first? - No, both held that the cabbage looses its special blessing, only one thought you bless the item you like more, and the other - that you bless the one that's healthier. If one had in front of him a whole loaf of bread and slices of better quality, which is preferable for saying a blessing? Rabbi Yochanan says that it is the whole one, and Rav Huna - that it is a better quality slice. Although the law in this follows Rabbi Yochanan, if one can eat from both and make peace between Rabbi Yochanan and Rav Huna - so much the better. Art: J.
