Pesachim 47 - Since If one bakes bread close to the end of a Holiday, essentially for the weekday following, then he is liable to punishment - says Rav Chisda. One is not allowed to cook during a Holiday other than for the needs of this Holiday. However, Rabbah says that since guests may happen to visit him just before the end of the day, and then he would feed this bread to them, therefore even now, he can be considered baking for a valid purpose, and thus he is not liable. This principle of "since" has so many implications that it gets a special name, "since," or "hoyil" in Hebrew. Therefore Rav Chisda and Rabbah begin to argue about it. For example, they discuss the following case. There is a situation where one can plow a single furrow and transgress eight times because of that. How so? - Firstly, he plows with an ox and a donkey tied together. Then, those animals are consecrated as sacrifices. Furthermore, he is sowing wheat in a vineyard. Besides, it is the seventh year (Shmita) when plowing is forbidden; moreover, he is doing this during a Holiday. He is a Kohen and a Nazirite, and he is plowing in a cemetery, which neither a Kohen nor a Nazirite can visit. That's eight. However, if the principle of "since" is true, then it should be only seven transgressions, and he should not be liable for plowing itself because, with the act of plowing, he produces dust, which can be used to cover the blood of a bird, a requirement of kosher slaughter. And "since" he can use the dust for this, it should not be counted! That is a question that Rav Chisda asked of Rabbah. However, Rabbah answered that he is plowing the rocky ground, with no dust. And the discussion continued. Art: Plowed Field by Edgar Degas Talk to MosesAI about it
