Menachot 3 - According to Rabbi Shimon, All Flour Offerings Remain Valid Earlier we said that there are two cases of flour offering where the wrong intent ruins the sacrifice. This ruling, however, does not accord with Rabbi Shimon, who says that the action of one who brings the flour openly manifest its type, and the wrong intention does not matter at all. For example, if this offering was already baked on a griddle, this determines its type. In this the flour offering is different from an animal, where the slaughter is the same for all types of sacrifices. Throughout the Talmud, Rabbi Shimon analyzes the reasons for the Torah commandments. Based on this analysis, he re-interprets the laws. For example, the law here is that the wrong intention should invalidate the flour offering. However, logic dictates that if from the offering itself it is clear what type it is, then the wrong intent should not matter - and that is how Rabbi Shimon rules.
