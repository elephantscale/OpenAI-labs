Taanit 20 - Better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar They declare a fast when it rains disastrously in one city, but it is a drought in another one. In analyzing this phrase from Amos, Rav Yehudah said - it is a bad sign for both. However, on other occasions, Rav Yehudah found good signs within bad ones. For example, "Jerusalem will be like a widow." - but not really a widow, rather, like a woman whose husband went overseas but plans to come back. Another case: prophet Achiya cursed Israel that God would smite it like a reed. And yet, reeds straighten out after a storm. On the other hand, Bilam blessed them to be like a tall cedar that withstands a strong wind. A strong wind - yes, but not a hurricane when cedar becomes uprooted. Thus, it is better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar. Moreover, the reed merited that a pen is made from it. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, was going home from his yeshiva on a donkey, and he was happy about the Torah that he had learned. A hideous man greeted him, but he replied, "How ugly is that man!" The man said, "Go back to the craftsman who made me and complain to him." Rabbi Elazar immediately got down from the donkey and started begging forgiveness, but the man was adamant. Only when the people of the town to which they were going interceded did the man grant forgiveness. Rabbi Elazar directed to the study hall, and his first lesson was, "A person should be pliable as a reed and not hard as a cedar." Art: Reeds in Shallow Water by Paul Baum Talk to MosesAI about it
