Pesachim 101 - New place, new blessing When people go to the synagogue on Friday night, they often hear a Kiddush there, even though they will repeat it at home. What is the purpose of that? That person who said the Kiddush and drank the wine did the mitzvah for everybody - so they do not have to repeat the Kiddush. If so, why do they repeat it at home nevertheless? - For the kids to hear it as well. Some say that the Kiddush must be in the same place where the meal will be, or else it is not a Kiddush at all. If so, what is the purpose of the Kiddush in the synagogue? - Sometimes, there will be guests in the synagogue who will stay and eat there, and it is for them. We see, therefore, that a place plays an important role. Abaye has a story to confirm this. When he was a student in the academy of Rabbah, and Rabbah would say a Kiddush for everyone - the students wanted to leave and go to their homes. Rabbah would tell them, "Please eat something! - Lest, your lamp will be extinguished, and you will not make a Kiddush at home." Rabbah's Kiddush did not count for them - because Kiddush must be in the same place where the Shabbat meal will be held. Art: Dinner table at night by John Singer Sargent Talk to MosesAI about it
