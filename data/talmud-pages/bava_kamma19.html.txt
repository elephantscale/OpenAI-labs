Bava Kamma 19 - Animals If an animal dropped dung onto a dough, ruining it, then it is not similar to pushing with the body, for which the owner pays full damages, but rather to pebbles shooting from under the animal's foot, for which the owner pays half damages. If a rooster extended his head into the hollow of a glass vessel and shrieked into it, breaking it, then this too is similar to pebbles, because the rooster did not do damage with his body but with vibrations. But isn't it abnormal? There were seeds there. Is an animal damaging by swishing its male organ similar to horn damage or to foot damage? Unresolved. Talk to MosesAI about it
