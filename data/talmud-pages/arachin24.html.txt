Arachin 24 - Redemptions from the Temple How does one collect debts from the Temple property? For example, if someone consecrated his possessions to the Temple, but part of them were needed to pay the Ketubah of his wife or his debt obligation - the one who redeems the complete amount refunds a part as a Ketubah or debt payment. The payments do not go directly from the Temple to individuals, so that people would not think that sacred property can be converted to private property without redemption. Although the Temple treasurers may force individuals to fulfill their Temple vows and even enter his house and seize his property, they leave him food for thirty days, clothing for twelve months, a bed and tools of trade - and sustenance is for him, but not for his family. One can consecrate his ancestral field to the Temple, and then redeem it at a fixed price prescribed by the Torah. The price of fifty silver shekels that we mentioned earlier is the maximum price for the 49 nine years until the Jubilee year. Since the field returns to him in the Jubilee year anyway, every year the price is reduced. However, because of a technicality, it is not reduced within the last two years before the Jubilee, and one should therefore be mindful of that when consecrating his field.
