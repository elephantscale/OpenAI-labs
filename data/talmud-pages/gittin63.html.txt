Gittin 63 - Divorce through a messenger Husband can appoint another man as an agent to deliver a Get to his wife, and wife can appoint another woman as an agent to accept a Get - because they appoint others like them to do what they are empowered to do. Moreover, husband can appoint a woman for the delivery of a Get, and wife can appoint a man for the receipt. Since they can be a party to divorce, they can also act as agents in any capacity.
