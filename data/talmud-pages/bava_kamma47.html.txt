Bava Kamma 47 - Someone's Things in My Courtyard If a potter brought his pots into a homeowner's courtyard without permission, and the homeowner's animal broke the pots, the homeowner is exempt from liability; and if the the homeowner's animal was damaged through the pots, the owner of the pots is liable to pay the damage. But if he brought his pots with the homeowner's permission and they were broken, the owner of the courtyard is liable. The same laws are true if one brought his produce into a courtyard, and an animal ate it or was harmed by it. Rebbi says: "The homeowner is not liable unless he explicitly accepts the obligation to guard it." Talk to MosesAI about it
