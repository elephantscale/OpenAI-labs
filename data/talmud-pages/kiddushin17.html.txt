Kiddushin 17 - Severance Gifts of Hebrew Servants If a Hebrew servant was ill for up to three years of his six-year term, he is not obligated to make up. What is the worth of severance gifts that a master must give to his departing servant? Three kinds of goods: sheep and goats, grain, and wine, for the total worth of thirty selah (equal to the penalty for goring a Canaanite slave), approximately $6,000. A Hebrew servant serves out his term under the master's son but not his daughter or any other inheritor. A Hebrew maidservant is free if her master dies, and does not serve anybody.
