Zevachim 82 - Which is Worse, Bringing Blood Inside or Taking It Outside? If the blood of a sin-offering is taken outside the Courtyard, it becomes invalid. Likewise, if it is brought inside the Temple Hall, it also becomes invalid. If one received the blood of a sin-offering in two cups and took one of these cups outside, the other cup remains valid. However, if one cup was brought inside the Temple Hall, then Rabbi Yosi still declares the second one valid, but the Sages invalidate it. Argued Rabbi Yosi, "The invalidation of taking the blood outside should be more serious, since even thinking of taking the blood outside already invalidates the offering." How can the Sages attach more importance to bringing the blood inside? - The Sages base their opinion on the verse "...that from its blood shall be brought inside." They explain this to mean that if any of it is brought inside, all blood is invalidated. Art: Adriaen Jansz. Van Ostade - Inside a Peasant's Cottage Talk to MosesAI about it
