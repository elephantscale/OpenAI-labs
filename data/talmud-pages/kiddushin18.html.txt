Kiddushin 18 - Master or his Son to Marry Hebrew Maidservant A Hebrew convert is like a new-born child and does not inherit his father, except by rabbinical ordinance. He has to tell his brothers, "Take these idols, and I will take the produce," before the idols come into his possession. A father can sell his daughter into servitude only once. Her master or master's son are expected to marry her and provide for her, with no additional Kiddushin money required. A Hebrew servant is sold for his theft if he can not repay, but only if what he owes exceeds the value of the six years of his servitude. Talk to MosesAI about it
