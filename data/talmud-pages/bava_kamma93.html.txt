Bava Kamma 93 - Invitation to Do Damage If one says to his fellow, "Blind my eye," "Cut off my hand," "Break my leg," and the fellow did so, the assailant is liable to pay for the damage. Even if the first person added, "on condition that there will be no liability," the assailant is nevertheless liable. If one says to his fellow, "Tear my garment," the damager is liable, but if the owner added, "on condition that there will be no liability," - the damager is not liable. If one steals pieces of wood and makes them into utensils, he pays the value as of the time of the robbery. Talk to MosesAI about it
