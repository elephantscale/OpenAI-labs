Shevuot 22 - Oath Not To Eat Asked Rava, "If one took an oath not to eat earth, how much must he eat to be liable?" Is it like all eating, a volume of an olive, or, since earth is inedible, he means even a minute amount? - Remains unresolved. If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate and drank, he is liable to only one offering. But if one swore, "An oath that I will not eat and that I will not drink," and then he ate and drank, he is liable to two offerings. If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate prohibited foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes - he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him, because he swore to something to which he is already obligated, and his new oath did not take effect. Art: Giacomo Ceruti - Sea Food Talk to MosesAI about it
