Bava Kamma 4 - How to Translate Mav'eh? Out of the four damagers: ox, pit, man, and fire, the term for "man", or "ma'veh" can have various translations. Rav translates mav'eh as a seeker, or man; Shmuel translates it as "tooth" of an animal consuming produce. Then how does this "tooth" differ from ox? The intent of eating (tooth) is to have pleasure, while the intent of goring (ox) is to harm. Rabbi Oshaya listed thirteen primary damagers: unpaid custodian, borrower, paid custodian, renter, bully, pain, healing, unemployment, and humiliation, plus the four primary damagers above. Why does the Mishna not include these? - It listed man and meant all types of damage inflicted by man. Talk to MosesAI about it
