Bava Kamma 2 - Four Categories of Damages There are four primary categories of damages, and all other cases can be classified as belonging to one of these: the ox, the pit, the man, and the fire. Liability for one can not be deduced from the other. For example, a man is responsible in full for even accidental damage, while the owner of an ox is liable for half the damage the first three times; a fire isn't alive, and a pit doesn't move around. However, since they can all cause damage, the owner is responsible for watching over them and paying damages from the choicest land. Talk to MosesAI about it
