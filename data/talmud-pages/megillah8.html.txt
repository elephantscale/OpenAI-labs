Megillah 8 - There is no difference There is no difference in the laws of the first and second months of Adar - except for reading the Megillah and giving gifts to the poor. For other laws - such as reading the four special Torah portions reminding of important events - they are equal. From here on, we have a series of "there is no difference" statements. There is no difference between the laws of Shabbat and Holidays, except that one is allowed to cook for people's consumption on Holidays. There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur, except that for doing work on Shabbat, one may theoretically be executed, and for the same on Yom Kippur - there is only "being cut off from one's people." There is no difference between a vow prohibiting one all benefit from the other person and a vow prohibiting food benefits - because many things lead to food - except for the permission to pass through his property. There is no difference between vowing to bring a sacrifice and designating a specific animal, except that when he vows and then buys an animal, and it is lost or dies, he has to buy another one. There is no difference between a zav (see here) who had two emissions and one who had three, but that the latter needs to bring a sacrifice. A metzora (spiritual leper) may be quarantined and declared a definite metzora. There is no difference between the two states, except that the latter also needs to let his hair grow and tear his garments as a sign of grief.
