Kiddushin 68 - Marriage with Gentiles From where do we know that Kiddushin does not take effect with a gentile? - "You shall not make marriages with them." From where do we know that her offspring is non-Jewish like her? - "For he will turn your son away from Me and they will serve other gods." Thus your grandson who comes from your Jewish daughter is called your son but your grandson who comes from a heathen woman is not called your son, rather, he is considered her son.
