Meilah 5 - Which Step In The Service Permits Misappropriation? Earlier we quoted a rule (actually stated by Rabbi Yehoshua), that once a strict offering (think burned-offering) has a moment of permissibility to the Kohanim, it is no longer subject to misappropriation. That is easy to understand: if Kohanim had any right in it, then it does not belong solely to God, and the strict laws of misappropriation do not apply any longer. On the other hand, if something went wrong in the sacrificial service, and the meat was not allowed for the Kohanim even for a moment, the laws of misappropriation still apply. Rabbi Yehoshua gave examples of both: if the service was complete, but the meat was left over, became impure, or was taken outside the Temple, the laws of misappropriation do not apply; but if a Kohen had wrong intentions during service, the prohibitions remain. At which exact moment is the law of misappropriation removed? Bar Kappara said to Bar Padda, "Please ask about the moment of permissibility in the study hall tomorrow, and be ready to discuss the question. Did Rabbi Yehoshuah mean the moment of slaughter, the moment of throwing the blood, or the moment when it can be eaten?" On the next day, Chizkiyah said that it was the moment of slaughter, and Rabbi Yochanan said that it was the moment of eating. In discussing this, the Talmud has to modify its understanding of many rules, and the discussion itself continued through the ages. Art: Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema - Discussion Talk to MosesAI about it
