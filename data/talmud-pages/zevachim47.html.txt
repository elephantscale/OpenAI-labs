Zevachim 47 - Proper Intentions and Proper Places for Sacrifices A sacrifice should be slaughtered with six intentions in mind: (1) for its own sake - a burnt offering should be intended as a burnt offering and not, for example, a peace offering; (2) that it should bring atonement to the owner of the sacrifice, and not someone else; (3) for the sake of God; (4) that it should be completely burnt on the fire of the Altar; (5) that it should give off the aroma while on the Altar, and not broiled before; (6) for the sake of pleasing God, Who has commanded and it was done. Even if the Kohen did not have any of these intentions in mind, it is still valid, and therefore the Court decreed that the Kohanim should say nothing at all, because they have the power to ruin things. Now we begin to study the proper places for sacrificial services. All most holy offerings are slaughtered to the north of the Altar. The first ones on this list are the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur service - their slaughter is to the north of the Altar, and their blood should be received in the service vessel to the north of the Altar.
