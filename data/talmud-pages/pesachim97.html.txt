Pesachim 97 - The sheep goes to graze The Passover offering slaughtered for the Seder must be a male animal, a sheep or a goat, in its first year. What happens when one designates a female animal or a male that is older than a year? The animal is a sacrifice but is not a fit for its designated purpose. Therefore, it is sent to graze in the pasture until it gets a blemish. Then it is sold, and the money is used to buy a replacement, which the owner then brings as a peace offering. What if someone designated a lamb and then died? The offering goes as an inheritance to his son. If the son was not registered to eat this offering, he cannot eat it this year, but he also cannot eat it the next year because by then, the lamb will be over a year old! Therefore, the son will later bring this animal as a peace offering. Art: Grazing sheep by Carleton Wiggins Talk to MosesAI about it
