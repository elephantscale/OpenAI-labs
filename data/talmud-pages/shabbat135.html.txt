Shabbat 135 - Circumcision for an androgyne Since someone who is androgynous may be predominantly a male or a female, he (or she) does require circumcision, but because he might be primarily a female, this circumcision is not performed on Shabbat. Circumcision involves making a wound, which is prohibited on Shabbat, so it is done only for a definite male, and in this case it will happen a day later. However, Rabbi Yehudah finds an indication in the Torah that androgyne is a special case and must be circumcised on Shabbat, if it is his eighth day. What is his source? The Torah said, "Circumcise all your males," and this extra word "all" includes the androgyne. Art: Adriaen The Elder Verdoel - The Circumcision Talk to MosesAI about it
