Chagigah 9 - What is right and what is wrong Jews traveled to Jerusalem three times a year, visited the Temple, and offered a sacrifice there. This sacrifice was called "Chagigah" or Celebration. Ideally, one should bring this sacrifice on the first day of the Festival. However, if he missed doing it on the first day, he can still complete the celebration by offering (and then eating) it on any of the remaining days of the Festival. What happens if he went to Jerusalem, visited the Temple, but did not bring a Chagigah sacrifice, and the Festival is now ended? He missed his chance, and nothing can be done now. The following statement by King Solomon applies to him, "A crooked thing cannot be straightened, and a lack cannot be counted." What are the other examples of irreparable losses? One misses the time to say the prayer of "Shema, Israel!" in the morning or evening. One who has relations with a woman who is forbidden to him (like a sister or another man's wife) and she gives birth to an illegitimate child (mamzer.) But some people do not agree that this phrase refers to these cases. They say to become crooked, one must start out straight. Who is this? - This is a Sage who went to the bad side.
