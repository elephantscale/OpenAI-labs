Yoma 22 - Priestly lottery The very first service of the day in the Temple was the separation of a small portion of ashes from the Altar and putting it down on the ground. Initially, any Kohen who wanted to do it could do it. When many Kohanim vied for the privilege, they would run up the Altar's ramp, and the first to reach the Altar would win. However, people started to fight. It happened that one pushed the other, who then broke his leg. The Sages, therefore, instituted a lottery, which was conducted in the following manner. All Kohanim would assemble in a circle. One would take off his hat - he was the one from whom the count started. The Temple administrator told them to stick out one of two fingers; he would call out a large number and start counting from the first Kohen in a circle. The one on whom the count ended was the winner. Why was there no lottery at first? Because the Sages expected that not too many people would rise early enough for this service. They reasoned that it is easier to stay late than to wake up early. Then they established running competition and later a lottery. However, the people stopped coming, saying, "Who knows if I will win the lottery!" So the Sages increased the reward, and the winner would get the removal of the ashes and two more subsequent mitzvot. And why did they count fingers and not people? Because one should not count the Jews. Art: An old man with a raised finger by Jacob Jordaens Talk to MosesAI about it
