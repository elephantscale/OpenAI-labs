Sanhedrin 108 - Bad Generations The people of the Generation of the Flood have no share in the World to Come, but on the other hand they will not have to stand in Judgment, having already been punished. "My spirit shall not contend ever more concerning man" implies neither judgment nor the spirit of God. The people of the Generation of Dispersion - the Tower of Babel - have no share in the World to Come, since God "dispersed them" in this world and "scattered" for the World to Come. The people of Sodom have no share in the World to Come, since they were "wicked" (this world) and "sinful" (World to Come). The people of the Generation of the Wilderness have no share in the World to Come, since they shall be "consumed" and "there they shall die" - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and applies to them "Gather to Me My devout ones, those who sealed a covenant with Me by sacrifice."
