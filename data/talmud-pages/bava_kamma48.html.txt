Bava Kamma 48 - An Ox Falls into a Cistern and Kills Someone If one brought his ox into a homeowner's courtyard without permission and the homeowner's ox gored it or the homeowners dog bit it, the homeowner is exempt from liability; and if the trespasser's ox gored the homeowner's ox, the trespasser is liable. If the trespasser's ox fell into the homeowner's cistern and fouled its waters, the trespasser is liable. If the homeowners father or his son was in the cistern and was killed by the falling ox, the trespasser must pay redemption reparation. But if he brought his ox into the courtyard with the owner's permission and it was damaged there, the owner of the courtyard is liable. Talk to MosesAI about it
