Sukkah 45 - Willow (aravah) As we mentioned earlier, the willow (aravah) was a special law taught to Moses on Sinai but never written down in the Torah. Nevertheless, it has many details. What are they? There was a low-lying place near Jerusalem called Motza. It had many willows there, and the court agents would gather willow branches (aravah.) The priest would stand the willow branches at the sides of the Altar, and their tips would bend over the top of the Altar. They would also blow trumpets as a sign of joy. On the first six days of the Holiday, they would circle the Altar once and say, "Please, God, save us! Please, God, bring us success!" On the seventh day, they circled around the Altar seven times. When they were leaving, they said, "We prepared this beauty for you, Altar!" On the seventh day, the adults would grab the lulav from the children and grab and eat the etrogs. The children did not mind because it was a sign of joy. Others translate this phrase differently: the children were throwing the lulav down and eating the etrogs. The intent was the same - to show the joy of completing the mitzvah. Art: Still Life with Lemon and Cut Glass, Mariretha van Os Talk to MosesAI about it
