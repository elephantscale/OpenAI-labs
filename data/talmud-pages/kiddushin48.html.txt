Kiddushin 48 - Betrothal with Loan Collection Rights or with Labor If a creditor sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow and afterwards forgives the debt - it is indeed forgiven. Therefore, if one betroths a woman by giving her a loan document for collection, she may fear that he will forgive the debt, and thus she does not wholeheartedly commit herself to the betrothal, which is therefore void. If a woman handed a piece of gold to a craftsman and said to him: "Fashion for me anklets, earrings, or rings, and in return for your labor I will become betrothed to you," - it is betrothal with a a loan, which is invalid.
