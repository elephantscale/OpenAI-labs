Gittin 88 - Divorce Procured by Force The "quickly" of the Master of the World is 852 years, because of the phrase "you will be aged (venoshantem=852) and you will be removed, quickly, from the Land." Concerning a Get that was procured by force, if the coercion was applied by the Jewish court and the husband acquiesced, the Get is valid. But if the coercion was applied by a court of idolaters, the Get is invalid. However even in a court of idolaters, they may beat the husband and tell him "Do what which the Jewish court tells you to do!" and the Get is valid. Talk to MosesAI about it
