Shabbat 19 - Lest he stokes the coals Although Beit Hillel have no problem allowing the vessels to work on Shabbat - barring such cases as loud mills - they do prohibit putting a pot into an oven just prior to sundown. Why? - Because in his desire to eat the meal, one can stoke the fire. It follows from here that if the food in the pot is completely raw, then it is allowed to put it into the oven. And why is that? - Since one has no hope of eating it on Friday night anyway, one will not come to stoke the fire. Prior to Shabbat, one should not sell any item to a non-Jew, or help him load it, because his subsequent carrying it home may seem as if he is doing this on the behest of a Jew - so say Beit Shammai - unless he can reach his home before Shabbat starts. However, Beit Hillel say that it is enough for him to be able to reach the first house in his town. Then, if he carries it to his home - that is his own affair. One should not give clothing to a gentile launderer unless he has time to finish it while it is yet day - so say Beit Shammai, but Beit Hillel allow it - provided that the Jew does not ask for them right after Shabbat. In the household of Rabban Gamliel they would follow the stringency of Beit Shammai, while white clothes were given even more time - since they are harder to clean. Even though this is not the prevailing law, it does teach us about cleaning. Abaye once asked a launderer, "How much to clean the colored garment?" - and the launderer told him that it is the same as white ones. Abaye said to himself, "Talmud teaches that he is cheating!"
