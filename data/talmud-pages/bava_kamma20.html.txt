Bava Kamma 20 - "Tooth" damages What are normal "tooth" damages obligating the owner in full payment? Fruits and vegetables. If an animal ate a garment or utensil, the owner pays half damage. When is this? On the damaged party's premises, but if the animal eats in the public domain, owner pays only for what he benefited by skipping its next feeding. Eating in a pinch, such as cats eating dates and donkeys eating fish, is normal damage. If one lives in the yard of his fellow without the latter's knowledge, does he have to pay rent? The inquiry is in regard to yard that is not for rent and a person who usually rents. Talk to MosesAI about it
