Taanit 17 - Why do Kohanim drink wine? A Kohen who is drunk cannot serve in the Temple. Since the Temple can be rebuilt any day, it follows that a Kohen who knows the day when he would be officiating in the Temple should not drink wine on that day. He should also not drink wine the week that he knows would be his week to serve. And since no Kohen today knows his lineage and Temple schedule, no Kohen should ever drink wine. However, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that although it is true, but what can he say - since their ruin (not being able to serve in the Temple) is also their defence: it has been many years that the Temple has not been rebuilt, and they can now drink wine any time. But, by the same token, they should also cut their hair at least every thirty days! Why? - Because drinking wine and growing long hair are prohibited in the exact same phrase. - No, that logic is wrong! If the Temple is rebuilt, and we are looking for a sober Kohen to serve there and can find none - then indeed we are in trouble. But a long-haired Kohen can quickly take a haircut and go officiate.
