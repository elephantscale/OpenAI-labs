Bava Kamma 104 - A Robber and Perjurer Repents and Seeks to Repay One who robs his fellow in the value of a prutah (5 cents) or more and then swears falsely to him denying the theft, but later confesses and wishes to repent must pursue him to the farthest land. He may not give it to the victim's son, nor to his agent, but he may give it to to an agent of the court. The court then holds the stolen property until the victim calls for it. The Rabbis enacted that this should suffice, to ensure that a potential penitent not be discouraged. The agent above is informal, but a formal agent appointed with two witnesses can receive the payment. Talk to MosesAI about it
