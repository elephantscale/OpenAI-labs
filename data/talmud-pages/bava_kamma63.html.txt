Bava Kamma 63 - Twofold, Fourfold, or Fivefold Payment for Stealing The rule of twofold payment applies to more situations than the rule of fourfold or fivefold payment, for the rule of twofold payment applies both to living things and to inanimate objects, whereas the rule of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to an ox or sheep. One who steals after a thief does not pay a twofold payment, because twofold payment applies only when "...it is stolen from the house of the man...". Likewise, one who slaughters or sells after a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Talk to MosesAI about it
