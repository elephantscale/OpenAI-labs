Pesachim 84 - Take the meat but leave the bones At the Seder, there should be enough meat of the Passover sacrifice for everybody. "Enough" means the volume of an average olive. But what is considered "meat?" - Any part that will be tender enough to eat in a grown-up animal is considered "meat." But any part that will harden in a grown-up ox is not considered meat towards the olive volume. We already mentioned that one is not supposed to break the bones of a Passover sacrifice. One can even be punished for doing so (of course, the usual rules of giving him a warning not to do it, within a few seconds before the act, apply). However, one is not punished for another prohibited action - leaving the meat over till morning. Why not? Some say - because you cannot punish for not doing. Others - that anytime something is prohibited but a correction is suggested - here, by burning it, you can't punish for it. Art: Butcher's shop by Annibale Carracci Talk to MosesAI about it
