Bava Kamma 115 - One Sees His Utensils and Books in the Possession of Another If one recognizes his utensils and books in the possession of another, and a report of burglary concerning him was circulated in the city, the alleged purchaser must return the property to the claimant and swear to him how much he paid, and the claimant pays. Otherwise, the claimant is not believed, for we can say that he sold them to another, and this person purchased them from him. If a river swept away his donkey and a more expensive donkey of his fellow, and he abandoned his and saved the donkey of his fellow, he receives only his rescue fee. If he stipulates payment for his donkey, he gets it. Talk to MosesAI about it
