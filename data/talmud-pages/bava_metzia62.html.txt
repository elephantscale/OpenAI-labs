Bava Metzia 62 - Interest is Collectable in Court Why is the Exodus from Egypt mentioned in conjunction with the prohibition of taking interest? It is as if God said, "I knew who was first-born in Egypt, and I will know those who falsely attribute their money to a non-Jew, and then lend it on interest." Neshech, or fixed interested prearranged at the time of the agreement, is prohibited by the Torah and can be collected in court. But Rabbi Yochanan says that "You shall not take from him (your impoverished brother) interest or increase; but fear your God," implies that he who takes interest is obligated to refund the interest out fear of God, but he is not subject to refund it by a court order.
