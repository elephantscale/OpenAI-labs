Nedarim 71 - The father and his son-in-law If a young girl makes a vow (for example, not to eat something), her father has veto power, and he can cancel her vow. However, this veto power only lasts for one day, after which the vow becomes valid like any other vow. Similarly, if a married woman makes a vow, her husband has veto power for one day. If a young girl is engaged (this is a complete engagement, requiring a proper divorce Get) for dissolution) but not living with her husband yet, then both the husband and the father have the veto power, which they would exercise jointly. What happens if a girl in this situation took a vow, then divorced, or her husband died, and then she got engaged again on the same day? The answer does not change even if she divorced and got engaged a hundred times on this day - her father and her last-in-row husband can jointly cancel her vow during this day. We see thus that the veto power does not go over to the father on the death of the husband, but rather the father and the last-in-row husband can jointly cancel the vow; as long as the girl was not fully married, she remains in part under the jurisdiction of her father.
