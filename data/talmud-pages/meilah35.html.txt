Meilah 35 - A Trip To The Temple (Middot) The area of the Temple Mount was five hundred by five hundred amot, or about 14-20 acres. Most chambers there were in the south, and most people would enter from the south. They would then turn to the right and circle around to their destination, because of the rule that all turns that one takes should be to the right. The exception to this rule were mourners and people excommunicated by the court. They would turn to the left, and immediately evoke the compassion of the onlookers, who would say to the mourners, "May the One Who dwells in this House console you." If he told them that he was excommunicated, they would say to him, "May the One Who dwells in this House instill compassion in the judges' hearts," - these are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehudah said to him, "You have made the judges out as if they overstepped the bounds of the law." Rather, they said to him, "May the One Who dwells in this House put reason into your heart, and you listen to the words of your colleagues." Inside the Temple Mount wall was a lattice-work fence. At one point in history there were thirteen breaches in it, made by the Greek kings. Later these were repaired, and the Sages instituted thirteen prostrations corresponding to them. Further inside the Temple were the Women's Courtyard with the balcony, Israelite's Courtyard, the Courtyard of the Kohanim, the Altar, and the Temple proper.
