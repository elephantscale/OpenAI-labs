Bava Kamma 112 - Defendant Needs to be Summoned and Present in Court When one lends money to another Jew, he should "...not take from him interest and increase...", and refund any interest if taken, "...so that your brother may live with you." If the father left his children interest money, even if they know that it is interest, they are not obligated to return it - because they have acquired it through the combination of the owner loosing hope to recover it, and the change of ownership domain. The court can't accept witnesses' testimony in the absence of the defendant - unless he refuses to come, and there are pressing circumstances. Talk to MosesAI about it
