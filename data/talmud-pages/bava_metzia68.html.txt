Bava Metzia 68 - Joint Venture Avoids Interest Prohibition Originally the financier supplied the capital, and the managing partner conducted the business. They would share equally in the profits. If the venture failed, the financier would sustain the loss. Since financiers were not eager, the Rabbis enacted that the managing partner sustain a share of the losses, corresponding to his share of the profits.

This free service constitutes interest, so the managing partner must also receive wages. Talk to MosesAI about it
