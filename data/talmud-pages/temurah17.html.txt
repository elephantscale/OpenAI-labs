Temurah 17 - Sometimes Exchanges Are More Stringent Than Sacrifices, And Sometimes Less Sacrifices are more stringent than their exchanges: a sacrifice can be used to create an exchange, but an exchange cannot be used to create another exchange; partners can consecrate an animal to be a sacrifice, but not to make an exchange; fetuses and limbs can be consecrated, as part of a live animal, but one cannot make an exchange of them. On the other hand, although it is completely impossible to consecrate a blemished animal, one can exchange a blemished animal for a sacrifice, and this exchange will work. In that way, one can create a blemished sacrifice, and in this exchanges are more stringent than regular sacrifices. And in this sacrifices and exchanges are the same: the offspring of a peace offering and its exchange are peace offerings; so are their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of time, with all the accompanying details. That is because peace offerings can be females, unlike, for example, burned offerings. Why did "end of time" have to be mentioned? - To disprove Rabbi Eliezer, who says on the next page that an offspring of a peace offering cannot be brought on the Altar.
