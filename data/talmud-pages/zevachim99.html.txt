Zevachim 99 - Which Kohen Does Not Get a Share in the Offerings A person whose close relative has died gets the legal status of a mourner (onein) for that day. A kohen who is a mourner is allowed to touch sacrifices - he does not make them ritually impure - but he cannot offer them, and he does not have a claim to a share to eat that night. A kohen who has a blemish, whether passing or permanent, does have a share in the offerings and is allowed to eat them, but cannot offer them or do any kind of sacrificial service. Any kohen who was disqualified at any point of the service - for example, if he was impure when the blood was thrown but later, when the fats were burned, he became pure - does not have a share in that offering. And one who does not have a share in the meat does not have a share in the hides. This is derived from the Torah phrase "The one from the among the sons of Aharon who offers (that is, who is fit to offer) the blood of the peace offering and the fat - the right thigh shall be his portion."
