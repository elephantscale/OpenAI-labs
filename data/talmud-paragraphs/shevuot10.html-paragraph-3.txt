 Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda has a different version of what Rabbi Shimon said: that the goats atone for progressively wider range of infringements, in order from New Moon to Festivals to Yom Kippur. Said the Sages to him, "If they are so similar, can a goat designated for the New Moon be brought on Yom Kippur ?" He said, "Yes. Even though they are not the same, they have that in common that they deal with purity of the Temple and its offerings."
