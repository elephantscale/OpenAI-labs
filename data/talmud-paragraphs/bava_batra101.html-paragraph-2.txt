 One who sells a lot to his fellow to build a catacomb for him upon it, or one who accepts a contract to make such a catacomb, must adhere to the following standards: each crypt has to be 4x6 amot; he must open eight recesses, three on one side, three on another, and two in the middle opposite the door; the length of each recess must be eight amot, and the height must be seven hand-breadths. Rabbi Shimon says, 4x8 amot. An amah (arm) is between 1.5 and 2 feet.
