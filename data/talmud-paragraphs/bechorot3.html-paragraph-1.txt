 Rabbi Yehudah allows selling an animal with a broken leg, because it can't work anyway. What would he say about selling a firstborn fetus? Is it allowed, because it can't work now, or is it prohibited, because it will be able to work later? Since in another place he gives the reason "because it cannot heal," and this reason does not apply to a fetus, we deduce that he prohibits it.
