Eruvin 84 - Two-storied building Imagine people living in a two-storied building. The residents of the upper floor ascend there through a staircase, and there is a balcony, or "gallery," on the second floor. They constitute two different courtyards: the residents living on each level have to make their own eruv (common food) in order to carry on their level on Shabbat.
