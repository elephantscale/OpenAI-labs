Megillah 28 - A synagogue in ruins A synagogue that has fallen into ruin and is not used for prayer nevertheless retains its sanctity. One may not eulogize ordinary people there (unless Sages are present, making it a public eulogy). One may not work there, such as making ropes or nets or spreading fruit on its roof. One should also not use the synagogue as a shortcut.
