Eruvin 31 - Marginally valid foods There are foods that are somewhat prohibited but that can still be used for a Shabbat eruv - communal food which permits them to carry in an alley. For example, if he bought fruit in the market and has a doubt if the tithes were properly separated, he can still use this for an eruv - since poor people can eat it, and he can make himself poor by renouncing all his possessions.
