 Earlier we learned that if one knows that it is Shabbat and does multiple acts of prohibited work by mistake, he is liable for a sacrifice for each violation. Why should this be the case? - Because he brings a sacrifice for each mistake. - Still, why not say that this is all one mistake? - Because the Torah said, "One who violates Shabbat will die, he will die" - we see multiple punishments for multiple mistakes. But that is talking about one who violates Shabbat knowingly!? - That we already know from another verse, and therefore, since the new law is not needed for its own sake, let's apply it to another context, where he violates Shabbat by mistake. This proves it.
