 What does the teacher mean by the word "ore?" Rav Huna said that it means literally light, and Rav Yehudah said that it means night. Initially, the Talmud understands that Rav Huna means it to be really in the morning, and one should search for chametz then. Why would one use a candle in the morning? - it's the early hours, and a candle can help. By contrast, Rav Yehudah really means searching at night, as soon as it becomes dark.
