Avodah Zarah 36 - Milk, Bread, and Oil of Idolaters Milk that an idol worshipper milked without a Jew seeing him is prohibited to drink, though not prohibited for benefit. Although the milk of a kosher animal is white, and that of a non-kosher animal is yellowish, if some amount of non-kosher milk is added to kosher milk, this will not be easily discernible.
