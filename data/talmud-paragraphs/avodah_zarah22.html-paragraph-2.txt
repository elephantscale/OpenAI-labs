 However, following this logic, we should allow to place female animals with female idolaters? No! This was prohibited, because idol worshippers commonly consort with their fellows' wives and sometimes an idol worshipper visiting his paramour will not find her at home, but may find a Jew's animal there, and sodomize it, since they preferred Israelite's animals to their own wives. This made sense, since his own animal might become sterile, and with someone's wife he might be discovered, thus the Jewish animal was the most defenseless creature.
