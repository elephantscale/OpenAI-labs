 Beit Shammai states that one cannot carry a child or a Torah into the street on a Yom Tov. Why not? Because they are not edibles. Beit Hillel allows this. We thus see that Beit Hillel has a rule: once something is permitted for the purposes of cooking, it is permitted for all purposes. But how do we know that this is a general argument and not just one about carrying? They also disagree about lighting the fire: once it is allowed for cooking, Beit Hillel permits it for all other purposes.
