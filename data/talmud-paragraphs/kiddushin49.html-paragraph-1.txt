 Or, if a man asks a woman to become betrothed with a silver coin, and it was found to be made of gold, or the other way around - she is not betrothed. In some situations, she may need silver and in some gold. Rabbi Shimon says that if he promised a silver coin but gave a golden one, she is betrothed, since he only mentioned silver "by way of example."
