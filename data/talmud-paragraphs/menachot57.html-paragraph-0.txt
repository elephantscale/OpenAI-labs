Menachot 57 - Why Flour Offering Should Not Leaven Had the Torah stated only "that you offer to God shall not be prepared leaven," I would say that this applies only to the handful burned on the Altar. But since the Torah added "flour offering," this tells me that the whole offering should not be allowed to rise. And, since it also added "any flour offering," I know to apply this law to all the various flour offerings. Furthermore, since the Torah continued "That you offer to God," it tells me that one violates a prohibition only with a valid offering, but not if it became invalidated.
