 It once happened that Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Yonathan were walking in a cemetery, and Rabbi Yonathan's tzitzit were dragging over the graves. Rabbi Chiya told him, "Lift them up, or else the dead will say, 'Tomorrow they are joining us here, and today they are mocking us!'" Rabbi Yonathan asked, "But do they know?" The Talmud goes into multiple proofs and disproof of whether the dead know what is going on in this world, with the tentative conclusion that they may know, because of their own high status, or because of the status of a live person who needs to communicate with them.
