Chullin 61 - The Signs of Kosher Birds The signs of kosher birds were not stated in the Torah. Instead, the Torah lists twenty-four types of birds that are not kosher, with the implication that all others are kosher. The Sages, however, said, "Any bird that claws is nonkosher, but any bird that has an added toe, has a crop, and whose gizzard can be peeled, is kosher." Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Tzadok saiys, "Any bird that part the toes of its feet when placed on a twig, so as to grab it better, is nonkosher."
