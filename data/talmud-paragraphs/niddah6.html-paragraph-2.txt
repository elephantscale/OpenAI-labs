 It happened that a maidservant in the house of Rabban Gamliel was baking breads of the Kohen's portion. Between every loaf, she would wash the hands and examine herself. After the last loaf she discovered that she was impure, and Rabban Gamliel rules all the bread impure. She argued, "Didn't I examine myself after every loaf?!" - and Rabban Gamliel said, "If so, they are all pure." In this story, the breads were terumah, Kohen's portion, and impurity applied! - while Rav Huna said that it should not!? Rav Huna would say, "It was the portion given to the Kohen from the thanksgiving offering."
