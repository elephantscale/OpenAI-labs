Chullin 46 - The Spine, The Liver, and The Lung If the spine was broken and its cord severed - the animal is a terefah. Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that the majority of the spinal cord must be severed, but Rabbi Yakov says that even if the spinal cord was merely punctured - the animal is a terefah. Rabbi Yehudah ruled stringently in practice, like Rabbi Yakov, but the law is like Rabbi Yehudah's own lenient view.
