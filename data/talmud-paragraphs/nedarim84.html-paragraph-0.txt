Nedarim 84 - What's allowed when everything is forbidden As we have seen, a husband has veto power over his wife's vows - but this is only if it concerns him in some way. For example, if she vows not to benefit from any human - he cannot annul that because she can still avail herself of "owner-less" produce, which includes fallen grapes, forgotten sheaves, and the corners of the fields. All these are left by the field owner for the poor in the "owner-less" state.
