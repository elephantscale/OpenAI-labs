Meilah 32 - Alexander of Macedon and the Elders of the South (Tamid) Since on the previous page we mentioned the sun, the Talmud here recounts a story that also mentions the sun: Alexander asked the Sages about ten matters, the first dealing with the sun. He said, "Which distance is greater, from heaven to earth, or from east to to west?" The question was of a spiritual nature, concerning the two types of Divine Providence for the righteous, but nevertheless it had to be clothed in physical matters. They answered, "From east to west is greater, since people can see the sun in the east and in the west, but not when it is directly above."
