 Rabbi Shimon, however, does not require women to wear tzitzit. Since the Torah says "you will see them (tzitzit)" this applies only during the day. And what do his opponents say? - Some say that "them" means other commandments, some - that it means all commandments, and some - that it means "it" - God's presence.
