 Similarly, Rabbi Yehudah permits to make sukkah only out of the same four species. His logic? Here it is: sukkah is more stringent than the lulav bunch since it applies both day and night, whereas lulav is only by day. Therefore, if the lulav bunch can have only one of the four species, the sukkah must certainly be made of the same materials. And what did the Sages answer? That this logic, seemingly strict, is, in fact, lenient and thus does not apply. If he does not have the right materials, he may ignore the sukkah and go live at home - which is unacceptable lenience; thus, the logic is incorrect.
