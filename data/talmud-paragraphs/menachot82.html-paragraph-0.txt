Menachot 82 - One Can't Use Tithe In Place of Regular Produce As we learned before, if one says, "I promise to bring a thanksgiving offering," he may bring it only from regular unconsecrated funds, and not from tithe. Why is this? - The Torah said, "You shall slaughter the passover offering to God, your Lord, flocks and cattle." However, this cannot be understood literally, because the passover offering can come only from lambs and goats, and not from cattle. Then what does the word "cattle" teach us? To compare every other offering to the passover one, and say that just as a passover offering is an obligatory sacrifice that can be brought only from your own regular funds, so too every obligatory offering may be brought only from regular funds, and not from tithe.
