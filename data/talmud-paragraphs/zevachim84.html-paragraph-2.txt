 Rabbi Yehudah disagrees about some disqualifications and says about them that they need to be taken down even if they were already brought up on the Altar. These include one that was slaughtered at night, whose blood was either spilled or taken out of the Courtyard. His logic says that only disqualifications that are allowed under certain conditions can stay on the Altar, but those that are not allowed anywhere else, have to come down.
