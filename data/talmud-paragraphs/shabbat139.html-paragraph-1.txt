 The people of Bashkar sent three queries to Levi, but by the time the messenger arrived, Levi died. Shmuel then said to Rav Menashia, "If you are sufficiently wise, answer them." The question was about putting up a canopy on Shabbat (which, if it has even a small a roof at its top, is akin to building), and the answer given was "I have reviewed all considerations and have not found ground to permit this." But he could have suggested a canopy which rolls to the side with a rope!? This would be permitted because it is obviously not building but opening or closing, or because adding to a temporary tent is permitted, only building it is forbidden. - The Bashkarians were not learned Sages, and they could have adopted other leniences, basing them on this one.
