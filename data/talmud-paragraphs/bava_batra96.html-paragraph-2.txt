 If one bought a barrel of wine and it spoiled withing three days, then Rav says that it was beginning to spoil at the time of the sale, and therefore it is a mistaken purchase, which can be returned. Shmuel says that "it is on his shoulders." This means either that it spoiled while being carried, or that the spoilage is due to the sins of the owner.
