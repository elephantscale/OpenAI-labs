 Another explanation of Rabbi Eliezer's statement is simply an "exaggeration" or special emphasis. He just wanted to emphasize that the egg can be eaten, so he included even the mother hen and said, "Everything can be eaten!" - even though the second part of the statement is obvious. He did say something similar on another occasion: "The egg may be eaten, and its mother, and the chick, and its shell." Obviously, the shell is not edible. And if you want to say that he meant, "Chick in a shell" - that nobody allows. We see then that it was said just to make the point.
