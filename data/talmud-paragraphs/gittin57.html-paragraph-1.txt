 Seven sons of a certain woman were asked to worship idols by the Roman governor. They all refused and were executed. She told the last one, "Go, my sons, and tell Abraham your father, you bound a sacrifice on one altar, and I bound sacrifices on seven altars." She was a reincarnation of the mother of Abraham.
