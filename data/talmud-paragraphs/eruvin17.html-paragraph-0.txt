Eruvin 17 - Fence of ropes Another possibility to spend Shabbat in a caravan in a desert is to surround it with ropes: they can stretch three ropes at a distance of three hand-breadths from each other. If the thickness of the ropes together adds up to a hand-breadth, then they have a valid fence ten hand-breadths high. They could also surround their camp with vertical poles, ten hand-breadths high, and place them at three hand-breadths from each other.
