Avodah Zarah 39 - Who is Trustworthy A fish that develops fins and scales only when it matures (such as the one called "sultanit") is kosher. Nevertheless, one needs to buy it from a trustworthy seller, who can distinguish it from similar non-kosher fish and take the non-kosher ones out. If it has fins and scales but looses them when it is caught, it is also kosher.
