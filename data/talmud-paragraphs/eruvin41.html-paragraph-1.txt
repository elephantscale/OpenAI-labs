We already discussed that one may not leave his residence area on Shabbat and Festivals - about two thousand steps from his abode. It may be a city, a stand-alone house in a field, or just a personal space, four steps around himself if he happens to be outside in the open area. Thus, if he is alone in a Shabbat field, he may walk the four steps of personal space, plus a circle of two thousand amot (roughly, steps). This circle is called his "techum."
