 Altar consecrations can be used to make a (forbidden) sacrifice exchange; the intention to eat them beyond allotted time, actually leaving them over, or eating them while impure makes one liable to punishment; even if they are redeemed, their offspring and milk are still prohibited; one who slaughters them outside the Temple is liable; they cannot be given to craftsmen working in the Temple as their fee. All of these are not true for Temple consecration.
