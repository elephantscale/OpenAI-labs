Sanhedrin 63 - Joining God with Other Powers When the Jews worshiped the Golden Calf, they said, "...These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the Land of Egypt." The word "brought" is in plural, as indicated by an extra letter vav. This means that the Jews continued to recognize the divinity of God, but paired Him with another entity. Had they said "brought" in singular, those who do evil to Israel (euphemism for the Jews themselves) would have been subject to extermination - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
