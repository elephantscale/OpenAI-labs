Nedarim 87 - The husband against grapes but not against figs If the wife makes a vow to not eat grapes and figs, and the husband confirms only the grape prohibition, then the figs prohibition is also established. This is because the Torah said, "The husband hears (and confirms) about it," which can be translated as "even a part of it." However, if he annuls only the figs part, he still needs to revoke the grapes. Some say that he needs to rescind the complete vow - because the Torah said, "Revokes it," meaning the whole vow needs to be revoked.
