Pesachim 31 - Loan Secured by Whiskey Imagine that a Jew borrowed money from a non-Jew and left some chametz (think whiskey or vodka) in the non-Jew's house as collateral. If after Passover the Jew defaults on the loan, the non-Jew keeps the chametz as a repayment. We can say that the chametz was already in non-Jewish hand on Passover retroactively, and now it is permitted for use.
