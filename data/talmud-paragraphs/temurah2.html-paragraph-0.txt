Temurah 2 - Sacrifice Exchange One may decide to exchange his sacrifice for another, a better or a worse one, pronouncing "let this animal become a sacrifice instead of that one." This is forbidden by the Torah, but his words take effect: the second animal becomes sanctified, although the first one still remains a sacrifice. In addition, he violates a negative commandment, and is subject to lashes. Therefore, we have the first ruling: "All can effect exchange, a man or a woman, but this is not a permission to do so, rather, if he did it, it's done, and he is liable to lashes."
