 There were also thirteen collection chests in the Temple, called "Shofarot," because they were in the form of a shofar, wide at the bottom and narrow at the top, to prevent people from taking money out of them while pretending to donate. They were for shekalim, new and old, and for various sacrifices. The "old shekalim" means someone's obligation from last year - which cannot be used for this year but has to go into a separate chest and be used for the needs of Jerusalem instead.
