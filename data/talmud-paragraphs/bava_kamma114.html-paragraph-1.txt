 If (illegitimate) customs collectors confiscated someone's donkey, but then out of compassion gave him an inferior one, or if bandits confiscated his garment and gave him another garment, they are his, because it may be assumed that their owners have despaired of retrieving them. However, if out of piety he wants to returns these, he can return them to the original owners, and not the robbers.
