 The appointed Kohen told them, "Those who are new to the incense service, come and draw lots" - since this service was conducive to riches. After that, all of the Kohanim would draw lots for bringing the sacrificial limbs to the fire (these limbs were previously left on the ramp). Some say that six Kohanim won that, and some say that it was one Kohen. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov says that the same Kohanim who put the limbs on the ramp now carried them to the fire.
