 After cooking, they can smear the dry meat with liquids. If they smeared it with oil, and that oil was "terumah" (the special gift that is given to the Kohanim priest that only they are allowed to eat) - here is what they do. If the people at the Seder are all Kohanim, they can eat the meat. But if some are regular Jews, they need to clean it. If the meat in this place was raw and did not absorb the oil, they simply rinse it. However, if it was fried and absorbent, they will need to remove the meat in that place, to the depth of one finger.
