Avodah Zarah 6 - Why Three Days? The prohibition to trade with idolaters begins three days before their holidays. But why is this? For example, one who sells an animal and its offspring before one of the Jewish holidays must inform the buyer, so that he does not transgress the prohibition of slaughtering a mother and its young on one day - and this prohibition is only one day before the holiday! - The difference is that this animal is purely for eating, but the idolater's case is for a sacrifice.
