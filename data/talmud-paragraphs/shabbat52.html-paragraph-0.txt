Shabbat 52 - What may an animal wear on Shabbat The Torah prohibited one to work his animal on Shabbat, by saying "On Shabbat don't do anything that constitutes work, you, your son, your daughter,â€¦ and your animal." Therefore, one cannot make his animal carry a load. If so, how can it graze, being that this is a prohibited labor of reaping? - The animal should be at ease, and restraining it would cause pain. Accordingly, the following rule tells us what constitutes not a burden, but normal animals' wear and can therefore be worn by animals on Shabbat.
