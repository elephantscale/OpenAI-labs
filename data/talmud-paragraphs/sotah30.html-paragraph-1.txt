 Actually, a thing is either pure for Temple service or not. However, the Sages classified the impurity into six levels, from the dead body (called the grandfather of impurity) down to the "father of impurity," the first level, the second level, and all the way to the fourth. For example, some say that if you have a dough from which the priest portion (challah) needs to be separated, then this dough has the same law as the challah itself and can become impure with third-degree impurity. Others say that since the challah has not separated, the dough can only become impure in the second degree, not the third.
