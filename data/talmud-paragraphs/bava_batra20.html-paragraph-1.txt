 One is not allowed to set up an oven in a house unless there are 4 amot (6 feet) from it to the ceiling. If after observing all precautions listed, he damages the property of another, he must pay for the damage. Rabbi Shimon says, "The Sages stated all the precautions with their measurements to make him exempt."
