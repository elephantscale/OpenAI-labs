 The liver, however, is so saturated with blood that salting is ineffective in extracting all of it. Abaye said to Rav Safra, "When you go to the Land of Israel, ask them, what do they do with the liver." Rav Safra posed the question to Rabbi Zerika, and he related that he himself stewed a liver for Rabbi Asi. Abaye was not satisfied. He said, "I had no doubt that you can cook the liver by itself. Can you cook it with other meats?" Since this was never resolved, people don't cook liver together with other meats.
