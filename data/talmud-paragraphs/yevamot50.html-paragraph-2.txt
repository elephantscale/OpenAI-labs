 The Sages, however, say that "There is Get after a Get," meaning that Get weakens the bond but does not dissolve it completely. Therefore, the first wife still needs a chalitzah, even after getting a Get. Also, the second wife is still connected to the brother, and if he gives her a Get, it is valid to the extent that he cannot marry her relatives, and she cannot marry his.
