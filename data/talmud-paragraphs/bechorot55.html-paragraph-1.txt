 Jordan is called that way because it is "yored mi-dan" - comes from Dan. Its source is the cave of Pameas. Why does it matter? - One who vows not to drink water of Pameas should not drink any Jordan water. Jordan's source - as is the source of all water in the world - is the river Euphrates. Why does that matter? For one who vows against the water of Euphrates. But we judge by common meaning, and that includes only Euphrates' water?! - Rather, if he vows against all water that comes from Euphrates.
