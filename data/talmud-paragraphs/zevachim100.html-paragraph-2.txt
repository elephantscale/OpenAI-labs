 But do we find anywhere a difference between before and after midday? - Yes, we do! There was a story about a kohen named Yosef who did not want to become ritually impure because of his wife's burial, and the other kohanim forced him. On the other hand, the Torah tell the kohanim not to go into the cemetery, with the exception of burying his relatives? We have to say that one ruling applies after midday, while other one - before.
