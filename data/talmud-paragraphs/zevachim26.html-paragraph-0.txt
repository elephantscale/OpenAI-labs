Zevachim 26 - Position of Sacrifices Each sacrifice had its prescribed place of slaughter. For example, the most holy offerings were slaughtered in the northern part of the Temple courtyard. If the Kohen stood in the southern part, stretched his arm into the northern part and performed the slaughter, it is valid. On the other hand, if he received the blood while standing in the southern part, the sacrifice is invalid.
