 They asked question on Rav, based on an old ruling (Mishnah) as follows: "If one asked his servants to prepare him an eruv with bread, and they did it in two places, then he can only walk in the common area of the two." However, he can surely move for more than for steps! And they answered that Rav lived for 300 years, both in the time of the Mishna and of the Talmud, and was thus the only Talmud Sage whose opinion was part of the Mishna; thus, this contradiction did not present a problem for him.
