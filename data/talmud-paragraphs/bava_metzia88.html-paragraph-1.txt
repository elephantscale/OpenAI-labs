 By Torah law, one is obligated to tithe only the produce that he grows and consumes - "...you shall surely tithe..." and "...you shall eat...", but not produce that one sells. However, the Sages have established that a tithing obligation is fixed also when the produce is sold or when Sabbath arrives.
