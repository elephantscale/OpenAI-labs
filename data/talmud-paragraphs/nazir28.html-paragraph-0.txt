Nazir 28 - A wife must drink with her husband If a husband hears of his wife's vow, he can annul it - but only on the day he hears it. If he heard of his wife becoming a nazir (or "nazirah") on the last day of her vow, he can annul it then. However, if the blood of one of the required sacrifices was already thrown on the Altar, he cannot annul it any longer - because from then on, she is not deprived of anything and can drink wine and go to the cemetery. His rights extend only to her self-deprivation, but not further.
