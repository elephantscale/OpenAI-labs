 Rav Ashi ended his lecture on the three kings with "Tomorrow we will continue with our colleagues." Menasheh came to him in a dream and asked, "You call us colleagues? Which place on the bread do you bless?" Rav Ashi did not know. "The one that is baked first," - said Menasheh. "Then why did you worship idols?" - asked Rav Ashi. "If you were in our generation, you would run to worship them yourself," said Menasheh. In the morning, Rav Ashi started with "Let us return to the three kings, our teachers."
