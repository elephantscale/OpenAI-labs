 What about bread baked in such an oven? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that the bread is forbidden - because the improvement in the bread was created by forbidden wood. But the Sages allow such bread. What could be their reason? - They say that the heat affects the bread after the wood has been burned, and thus it is not a direct result of the forbidden wood.
