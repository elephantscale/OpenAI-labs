Menachot 55 - Exception Proves the Rule All flour offerings are kneaded with lukewarm water. Had they used scalding hot water, the offerings would become invalid, and had they used cold water, the dough would be clumpy. Now, however, since they used lukewarm water for best quality, they had to take special care that the dough does not become leavened, and the Kohen would have to continually work the dough to forestall its leavening, for the rule is that all the time that one keeps kneading the dough, it does not leaven.
