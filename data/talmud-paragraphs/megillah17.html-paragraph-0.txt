Megillah 17 - The order of blessings Obviously, one should read the Megillah from the beginning to the end. However, obvious things are not stated in the Talmud, and instead, we deal with exceptions. If one reads the Megillah in the wrong order of words, verses, or paragraphs, he has not fulfilled the mitzvah. He should read it from a scroll; reciting by heart is also invalid.
