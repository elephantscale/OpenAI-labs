 The Torah gave a general rule, "Any flour offering shall not be prepared leavened." Therefore, I would think that there is only one set of punishment for any specific work. Then the Torah stated an exception, "shall not be baked (leavened)." Baking was already included in the rule, so why is it excepted? To make one liable for each individual act. Thus the exception proves, or rather explains, the rule.
