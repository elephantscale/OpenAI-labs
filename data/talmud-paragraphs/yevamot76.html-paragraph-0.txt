Yevamot 76 - The congregation of Israel We mentioned earlier that one who has his testicles wounded or crushed and one whose member is severed cannot "enter the congregation of Israel," He cannot marry a Jewish woman born as a Jew. However, he can marry a convert. Although converts are Jewish in every respect, they are not encompassed by the term "congregation." Their children, however, will be called "congregation."
