 If he placed his eruv food atop a reed or a pole, even hundreds of feet high, it is valid - provided that the reed was uprooted and later stuck back into the ground. Why being uprooted makes a difference? - In trying to remove his food from the reed's top, he may accidentally break off a piece, and in doing so he will perform the labor of reaping. This is prohibited even at twilight, when the eruv should have taken effect, and thus it never becomes valid.
