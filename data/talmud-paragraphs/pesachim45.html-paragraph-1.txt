 There are qualifications to this rule, though: it is only applicable to the trough's upper part, which does not hold water. The bottom part of the trough, where kneading takes place and where water enters, needs to be strong, so there even larger dough pieces are used to strengthen the trough, and therefore they don't have to be removed.
