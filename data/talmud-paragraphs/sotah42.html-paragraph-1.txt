 He says, "Listen, Israel (Shema, Israel!), you are approaching an enemy." He uses the word "enemy" to emphasize that if Jews were fighting against Jews, as it happened between the tribes at times, they could expect the victors to be merciful with the captives. He then quotes historical episodes to prove the point. However, with enemies, it is not like that; they will not pity you. This understanding caused them to fight with all their might.
