Chullin 21 - An Animal Whose Neck Was Broken Zeiri taught the following rule: an animal whose neck was completely broken before it was slaughtered is considered to have died by itself. Therefore, it carries spiritual impurity as a nevelah, more so than a correctly slaughtered animal, which, although it may have been sick and thus not kosher, still does not carry spiritual impurity.
