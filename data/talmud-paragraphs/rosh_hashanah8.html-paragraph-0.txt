Rosh Hashanah 8 - When do animals give birth Every year one must tithe his animals: all of them born this year are gathered into a pen with an opening large enough for only one animal to pass through. The owner then stands at this opening and counts, marking every tenth one with red dye. The animals thus designated are brought as offerings in the Temple. Their meat is eaten by the owner and his guests in Jerusalem. We must therefore know when is the New Year for animal tithe.
