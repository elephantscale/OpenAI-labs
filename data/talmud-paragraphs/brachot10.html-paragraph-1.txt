 People of refined character ("Vatikin") would always say the Shema just before sunrise, so that they could then start their Amidah (prayer said while standing, or Eighteen Blessings) with the sunrise. "Vatikin" can also be translated as "devoted ones," or "sharp, analytical individuals." In that way, they could say the Shema at the right time, the Amidah at the ideal time, and moreover join the past redemption (Exodus, mentioned in the Shema) to the future redemption, mentioned in the Amida. Anyone who does this can expect that no harm will befall him that day.
