Brachot 45 - Three people ate together The Torah said, "And you shall eat, and be satisfied, and you shall bless God your Lord for the good Land that He gave you." We thus see that after a complete meal with bread, one must say a prayer containing thanks for the sustenance, for the Land of Israel and for Jerusalem (the good Land).
