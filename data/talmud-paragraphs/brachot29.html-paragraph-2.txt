 Why are there precisely eighteen blessings? - This corresponds to the eighteen praises of God in the psalm of David, some say, to the eighteen mentions of God in the Shema, and others - to the eighteen vertebrae in the spine, which bends in prayer. Later, another blessing, directed against the persecutors of the Jews, was inserted, but the prayer retained it name, "Eighteen blessings." But the number eighteen had a basis! There is yet another name of God in this psalm, another name ("One") in Shema, and another small vertebra.
