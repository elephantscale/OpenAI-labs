 The phrase "And if you don't heed this, My spirit will cry in hidden chambers, because of your haughtiness" can be understood to mean that God cries because the exaltedness of Israel was removed, and some say because the exaltedness of God was removed. But is there crying before God? - Yes, in the inner chambers, and because of the Temple's destruction.
