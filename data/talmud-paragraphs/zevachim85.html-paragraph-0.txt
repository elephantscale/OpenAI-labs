Zevachim 85 - These Must be Removed from the Altar The following offering parts, even if valid, have no place on the Altar, and must be removed for this reason, even if they were put there: the meat of most holy and of regular holy offerings. Meat from the former is eaten by the kohanim, while meat from the latter is eaten by the owners of the sacrifice. Also in this category are flour offerings of barley brought on Passover and the two loaves brought on Shavuot, the show-bread, the remainder of a regular flour offering (since it is eaten), and the incense - since it is only offered on the inner Altar, not the outside one.
