 Moreover, one who did not follow the laws of propriety was subject to lashes given by the court. For example, Rav used to order lashes to one who cohabited with his deceased brother's wife without first declaring marriage intent. He also prescribed lashes for one who betroths a woman by cohabitation. Even though cohabitation is the only form of engagement mentioned in the Torah, the Sages decreed additional, preferred forms: money (ring) or a document. Some say Rav only gave lashes in this last case because it is licentious behavior.
