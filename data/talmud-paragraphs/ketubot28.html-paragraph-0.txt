Ketubot 28 - Childhood memories An adult can testify in court about his childhood memories, and even though he would not be believed at the time when he saw these events, he is believed now. For example, one can say, "I recognize the handwriting of my father, or teacher or brother, which I saw when I was young," and he would be believed in court.
