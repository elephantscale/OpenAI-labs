Eruvin 62 - One who does not accept the laws of eruv If one shares a courtyard with an idolater or with someone who does not accept the laws of the eruv, then the laws of the eruv do not apply, and one cannot carry in his courtyard. Why is that? Eruv (common food) makes everybody into one family, so that it is not many families living in this courtyard, but just one. If so, one can carry in this courtyard, because nobody is going to confuse this situation with carrying in a public street. However, one who does not agree with the rules of the eruv cannot join it.
