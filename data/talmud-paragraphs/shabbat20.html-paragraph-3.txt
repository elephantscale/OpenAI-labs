 Another prohibited material is willow tree. Ravin and Abaye were once walking in the Tamrurita valley when the saw some willow trees. Ravin said to Abaye, "This is the will tree that we learned about, forbidden to be used as a wick on Shabbat." Abaye replied to him, "But that is just a tree!" Ravin then peeled some bark off one of the tress and showed Abaye the wooly substance within.
