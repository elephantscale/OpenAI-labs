 If thieves entered a house and stole earthenware vessels but then returned them - they are believed to say "we did not touch the inside," which would preserve the containers for use with sacrifices. This sounds strange. Thieves are usually ignorant of the details of ritual purity, and if they entered a house, we should presume that every room they had the time to reach should have its vessels impure! - These are exceptional thieves: they repented. Thus, they are believed in the purity of sacrifices also.
