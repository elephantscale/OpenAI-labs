Meilah 5 - Which Step In The Service Permits Misappropriation? Earlier we quoted a rule (actually stated by Rabbi Yehoshua), that once a strict offering (think burned-offering) has a moment of permissibility to the Kohanim, it is no longer subject to misappropriation. That is easy to understand: if Kohanim had any right in it, then it does not belong solely to God, and the strict laws of misappropriation do not apply any longer. On the other hand, if something went wrong in the sacrificial service, and the meat was not allowed for the Kohanim even for a moment, the laws of misappropriation still apply. Rabbi Yehoshua gave examples of both: if the service was complete, but the meat was left over, became impure, or was taken outside the Temple, the laws of misappropriation do not apply; but if a Kohen had wrong intentions during service, the prohibitions remain.
