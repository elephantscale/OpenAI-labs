 Rabbi Yehoshua counters that if no Kohen was in town on Friday then he won't come on Saturday - because one cannot travel on Shabbat, but the Sages say that a Kohen might be on the road close by. "If you are so careful," - said Rabbi Yehoshua - "then why did you allow burning Kohen's portion which may have become impure? Perhaps Elijah the Prophet will come and reveal that this bread is pure?" To which the Sages replied that it is well known that Elijah will not come on Friday when the Jews are busy preparing for Shabbat.
