Yoma 73 - Urim VeTumim The same eight garments of the High Priest discussed so far were also needed when consulting Urim VeTumim. Incidentally, the Kohen appointed for battle would go with the Jews to war and wear the same eight garments. After the war, he continued to serve in the Temple in the same outfit. Others say that he does not serve in the Temple at all. We cannot permit him to be like the High Priest because the real High Priest will feel bad about it. Neither can he wear the garments of a regular Kohen because they only raise in the level of holiness but never bring down.
