Chagigah 26 - Thieves who repented We learned before that the ignorant people were not trusted about ritual purity. This leads to a problem: since clay vessels are often used for sacrifices, and since after use they becomes "leftovers" (or "notar") and hence must be broken, and furthermore, since no kilns were permitted in the Jerusalem - people could not obtain clay vessels that would be ritually pure. Therefore, the Sages lifted their distrust of the ignorant, but only under specific circumstances: clay vessels manufactured between Jerusalem and Modiin were declared ritually pure. This was only true for craftsmen in Modiin who were heading toward Jerusalem and not for resellers.
