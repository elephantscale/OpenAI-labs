 Mar Ukva sent a question to Rabbi Elazar, "There are bad people who hurt me, and I can give them away to the government, should I?" Rabbi Elazar took out a piece of parchment, made lines for writing and wrote, "Let me not do wrong with my mouth with an evil person is in front of me." Mar Ukva replied, "But they are torturing me!" Rabbi Elazar then wrote, "Be silent unto God, and the enemies will disappear." Rabbi Elazar's words took effect right away, and the enemies of Mar Ukva were led away in chains.
