Zevachim 89 - Who Deserves to Come First If there is a choice of two actions, the more frequent comes first. For example, daily offerings are brought before the additional Shabbat offerings. The rule is applicable to all situations, but it is derived from the order of sacrifices, as the Torah has said, talking about additional Passover offerings, "Besides the morning burnt offering which is continual burnt offering, shall you offer these," - which teaches that the regular daily burnt offerings come first.
