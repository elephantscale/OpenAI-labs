Shabbat 9 - Afternoon Afternoon of any day, not only Shabbat, is the time for the Afternoon prayer (Mincha). Since the time for it ends at sundown, there some activities that one should not start, lest he be absorbed in them and miss the prayer. Therefore, one should not sit down before a barber to have his hair cut close to the time of the Afternoon prayer, he should not enter a bathhouse or a tannery, nor may he begin to eat, nor may he start to judge a case of law. However, if he started any of these activities, he need not interrupt, but he may finish and pray after that.
