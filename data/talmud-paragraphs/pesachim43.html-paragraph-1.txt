 A third source comes to reconcile these contradictory indications. There is an extra word "anything" in verse, "You must not eat anything leavened." This extra word shifts the balance and is used by Rabbi Eliezer to obligate women to abstain from chametz. And once this is achieved, the connection between not eating chametz and eating matzah at the Seder is restored, and women become obligated to eat matzah.
