Niddah 38 - The Term of Pregnancy The pious ones of old would cohabit only on Wednesdays, so that their wives would not come to cause desecration of the Sabbath by giving birth on a Sabbath. The normal pregnancy term in either 271 days, 272, or 273, so the birth would occur on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday. But - asks the Talmud - cohabitation on Thursday, Friday, or the Sabbath also cannot lead to a birth on the Sabbath!? - True, understand "only on Wednesdays" as "from Wednesday onward."
