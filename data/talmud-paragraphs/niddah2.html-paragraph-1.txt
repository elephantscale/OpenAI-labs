 Shammai says that, nevertheless, only those foods that she touches from now on become impure. That is because there is a rule of preserving the status quo: the woman was pure before, so we can assume that she only becomes impure from the moment when she actually sees the blood. Hillel, however, says that we go all the way to the previous examination, even days back, and declare all foods that she touched potentially impure - since the blood may have appeared right after her last examination. Hillel agrees to the status quo principle, but in this case, there is something that weakens the presumption - she sees actual blood.
