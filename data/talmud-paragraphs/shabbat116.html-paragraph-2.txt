 A related question: the side margins of the Torah scroll, may they be saved from fire? Do we say that the scroll that had letters - once the letters have been erased - looses its sanctity and may not be saved, but the margins, which never had letters, are more sanctified and may be saved? Or the other way around, if the letters once were there, then the sanctity persists, but not if they were never there? Here too the views are divided.
