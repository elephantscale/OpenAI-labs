Sukkah 38 - You can do it all day The actual mitzvah to be performed with the Sukkot bunch is to "take it," and that is why the blessing is "...Who commanded us to take the lulav" - with the lulav (palm branch) being the highest of the rest. However, the Sages added the requirement to also wave the bunch in all the directions of the world and up and down. This is to show that one is doing it for the sake of the One to whom all directions of the world and heavens and earth belong. Another explanation: to protect from harmful winds on all sides, which shows that even the non-essential parts of a mitzvah (such as waving, which is not obligatory) have the power to stop bad things from happening.
