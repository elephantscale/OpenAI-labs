Niddah 9 - Definitions of a Virgin, Pregnant, Nursing, and Old Women One of the four types of women who are not given retroactive impurity, even if they see blood, but are only ritually impure from this moment on, is a virgin. However, this type of virgin is someone who never saw blood in her life, not one who never cohabited with a man. Actually, there are three types of virgins: virgin woman, virgin soil, and virgin sycamore tree - and the precise definitions are important for marriage contracts and contracts of sale, but our virgin is of the fourth type. Since Rabbi Meir said that "Any woman whose bloods are abundant, her children are abundant," - it is the absence of this type of virginity that is desirable to the prospective husband.
