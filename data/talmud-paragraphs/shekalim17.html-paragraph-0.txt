Shekalim 17 - Bow down thirteen times When one visited the Temple, he had to bow down (actually, completely prostrate himself on the floor) thirteen times against each of the thirteen gates. The gates each had a name and some - a story connected to them. This, however, is the opinion of Rabbi Abba, but the Sages say that there were only seven gates. If so, what were the thirteen prostrations for - since the Sages agree to that fact? - The Sages say that after the Greeks made thirteen breaches in the Temple inner wall, and then the Hashmonaim (in the time of Chanukkah) repaired them, the thirteen bowing down commemorated that fact.
