 In general, the Torah itself can be a cure for some but poison for others. This is the meaning of the phrase, "And this is the Torah that Moses put ('sam') in front of the Jews." The word "sam" means a drug of any kind and can cure or kill. Some say that one should learn it for the right reasons, and others - that he should understand it deeply enough.
