Nedarim 50 - The vow of the satiated dog Kalba Savua was a rich man who got his name because everybody who entered his house hungry as a dog (Kalba) would leave it satisfied (Savua). His daughter Rachel saw Akiva, who was an unlearned shepherd forty years old, and made a deal with him: she would get engaged to him if Akiva promised her to go study Torah. Akiva pledged to, and they got engaged in secret. When Kalva Savua found out, he vowed against her getting any benefit from him and his possessions, and Rachel had to leave the house. They lived in poverty, and Akiva cried, removing a straw from her hair, and promised to give her a gold diadem in the form of Jerusalem if he ever got rich.
