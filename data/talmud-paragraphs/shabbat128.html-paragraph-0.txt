Shabbat 128 - Caring for the chicken, calves and children Rule #1: we may invert a basket in front of chicks, so that they may climb up to and down from their nests. What's the story here? - On Shabbat, all animals were declared "not prepared," or "muktzeh" by the Sages, out of the consideration that one may cut off a branch of a tree in order to hit a horse or another animal. However, rule #1 tells us that even though the basket becomes temporarily muktzeh itself, while a chick is on it, one may move it it order to help the chicks.
