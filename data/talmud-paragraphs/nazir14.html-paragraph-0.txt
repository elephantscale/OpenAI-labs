Nazir 14 - Nazir because of the birth of a son If one says, "I am becoming a nazir," and "When a son is born to me, I will become a nazir," he becomes a nazir and begins counting his thirty days. If a son is born to him before he completes his own period of nazir (which he did not expect), then he completes his own, and after that, he becomes nazir for the birth of his son.
