Menachot 12 - Wrong Intentions for a Flour Offering If a priest took off a handful of flour with the intention to eat its remnants outside, or even an olive's volume of its remnants outside, or he wanted to burn it or its frankincense outside the Courtyard, the offering becomes invalid. These were all intentions for a wrong place. However, if he wanted to eat the remnants the next day, or burn the handful the next day, or perform any other services at the wrong time, then not only the offering becomes invalid, but one who eats it qualifies for being cut off from the people - provided that the rest of the service is done right.
