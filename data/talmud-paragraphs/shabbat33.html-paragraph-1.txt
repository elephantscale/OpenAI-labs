 When one hates others for no reason, not because they have committed reprehensible acts, but just because he does not like them, he does not have peace in his own household. This is logical: since he does not want peace for others, he is deprived of it himself. Conversely, when he genuinely loves others, he is rewarded with peace and long life in his family.
