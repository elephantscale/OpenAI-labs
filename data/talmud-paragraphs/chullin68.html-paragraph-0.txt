Chullin 68 - The Meat in the Field If one slaughters a pregnant animal, the fetus is considered to have been slaughtered together with its mother, and it does not require a shechitah of its own. Of course, it has to be killed before being eaten, but that killing can be done in any possible way. In fact, if two such animals grow up and have an offspring, this offspring does not require shechitah either.
