 For example, when one takes objects to a mikveh to purify them by submersing in its water, he can dip them with one object being inside the other - so long as the water enters into all areas of the object; but this is allowed for priest's portion but not for holy objects. Why? It may happen that one of the objects, the one which is inside the other, is too heavy, and the place of their contact does not admit water. That is not a serious concern though, and the Sages added this only for holy objects.
