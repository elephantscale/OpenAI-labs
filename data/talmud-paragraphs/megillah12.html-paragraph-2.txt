 The students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai asked him, "Why were the 'enemies of Israel' (euphemism for the Jewish people) on the brink of extinction?" He said, "You say the reason." They answered, "Because they ate at the feast of Ahashverosh." He questioned, "If so, only the people in Shushan should have been punished." They then asked, "And what is your reason?" Rabbi Shimon told them, "Because they bowed down to an idol." The students then asked, "If so, they should not avoid punishment!" He told them, "They did not mean it and lacked conviction. So too, God did not mean it and only scared them."
