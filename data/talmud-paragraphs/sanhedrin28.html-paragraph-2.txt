 How does one understand "Fathers shall not be put to death because of their sons nor shall sons be put to death because of their fathers..."? We already know that "...each man shall be put to death only because of his own sin." Therefore, we have to understand that "Fathers shall not be put to death because of the testimony of their sons."
