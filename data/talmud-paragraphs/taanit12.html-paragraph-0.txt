Taanit 12 - Fasting for part of a day Can one accept on himself to fast for only a part of the day? Rav Chisda said that it is impossible: it is not considered a fast if he ate before the end of the day. Then what is the concept of a partial fast? Rav Chisda will answer one who was too busy to eat in the first part of the day, and then decided to accept the fast until the end of the day: such a fast is valid, and he is even allowed to say the special prayer "Answer us!" for the fast days.
