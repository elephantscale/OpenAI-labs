Brachot 13 - Remembering Egypt The "Shema" consists of three parts, and the third one talks about tzitzit, which are not worn at night. However, it also mentions going out of Egypt, and for this reason Ben Zoma maitains that one should say it, even in the evening recitation of Shema, because the Torah required to "remember Exodus all the days of your life." "Days" means just that, days, but "all days" includes nights. However, the Sages say that it is not necessary to mentions Exodus at night. How do they explain the word "all?" - To include the Messianic era. Ben Zoma then questioned the Sages, "But the Exodus troubles will be forgotten in the Messianic time!?" The Sages answered him, "Not forgotten entirely, but only relegated to the second place, in view of the new miracles that will happen then."
