 A Roman by the name of Tinneius Rufus kept losing arguments with Rabbi Akiva in front of the Roman Emperor. The wife of Tinneus, who was extremely beautiful, suggested this: if the husband gives her permission, she will go and seduce Rabbi Akiva. Since Jewish God hates promiscuity, Rabbi Akiva will lose God's favor, and Tinneus will win over him. She got permission. When Rabbi Akiva saw her, he spat, laughed, and cried. She asked, why? He said he would tell her two reasons, but not the third one. He spat because, beautiful as she was, she came from a putrid drop. He cried because even her exceeding beauty would one day rot in a grave. He did not tell her that he saw that in the future, she would convert and marry him. She then became remorseful and asked him if she could repent her previous misdeeds. He answered, "yes." She converted and eventually married him, bringing him wealth.
