Pesachim 45 - Dough in the cracks of a kneading trough It is normal to have some dough stuck in the cracks of a kneading trough. If the amount of this dough is more than an olive volume, one must dispose of it for Passover. However, if it is less than an olive, then it is considered nullified due to its small size, and one can keep it there.
