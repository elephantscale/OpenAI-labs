Shabbat 135 - Circumcision for an androgyne Since someone who is androgynous may be predominantly a male or a female, he (or she) does require circumcision, but because he might be primarily a female, this circumcision is not performed on Shabbat. Circumcision involves making a wound, which is prohibited on Shabbat, so it is done only for a definite male, and in this case it will happen a day later.
