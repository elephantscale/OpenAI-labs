Arachin 6 - Money for Charity If an idolater separated a Kohen's portion (terumah) from his grain, saying "I wanted to do what Jews do" - this is a valid. However, if he said nothing, then perhaps he meant for the Temple, and since there is no Temple, it has to be hidden. In general, any "consecration for the Temple" today creates a similar problem.
