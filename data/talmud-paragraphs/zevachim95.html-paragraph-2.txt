 Resh Lakish asked a question - What happens if the robe of the High Priest was spattered with blood, taken outside the Courtyard, and there it became impure. The advice above cannot be applied, because it is forbidden to tear this robe. It needs to be brought inside and laundered there, but it is forbidden to do so, because it is impure. One is also not allowed to dip it in a mikva to remove its impurity - because that would be the beginning of washing, and washing can only be done inside the Courtyard.
