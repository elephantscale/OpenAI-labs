 How much water does the Kohen put in? Half a log, or about 5 ounces. Rabbi Yehudah says he takes only a quarter of a log or about 2.5 ounces. Parenthetically, Rabbi Yehudah will also require a shorter text to be erased into this water later in the preparation. The Kohen enters the Temple building, turns to the right, and finds a particular stone with a ring. He lifts up the stone, gets the dust from under it, and makes it float on the water.
