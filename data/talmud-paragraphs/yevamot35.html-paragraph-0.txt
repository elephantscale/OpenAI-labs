Yevamot 35 - The widow who is pregnant If one's brother dies childless, the remaining brother is bonded to the widow, so he must either do a yibum (which serves as marriage) or a chalitzah (akin to divorce). However, since the widow may be pregnant, the Sages established that neither yibum nor chalitzah can be done for ninety days after the brother dies.
