 What if one did not create this food eruv? - Then he is forbidden to cook for Shabbat. What about his flour? Is it also forbidden? But why do we ask? - For the case when others would want to help him out and bake with his flour for him, can they use the flour? - The answer is that they cannot, but rather, they have to receive from him the ownership of this flour, and then they can cook for him with that flour because it is now theirs.
