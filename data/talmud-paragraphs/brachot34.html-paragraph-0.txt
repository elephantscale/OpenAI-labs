Brachot 34 - Wrong prayers If one says in his prayer, "You have mercy even on a bird's nest" - they silence him. Some say, because he creates envy between birds and other creatures, but some say this is because he thinks that he explained God's actions as based on mercy, whereas in reality it is not mercy that dictates God's actions, but it is God's actions that define what mercy is.
