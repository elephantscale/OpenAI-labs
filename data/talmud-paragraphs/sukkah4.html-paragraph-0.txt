Sukkah 4 - Fixing the height of the sukkah We mentioned that the sukkah cannot be higher than twenty amot (about 30 feet). What if one's sukkah is higher than that, and he decides to pile pillows and blankets on the floor? Unfortunately, we tell him that it does not help because he plans to remove them later, and so they are regarded as non-existent even now. What if he says, "I abandon these pillows here, for the seven days of the holiday?" - No use either because most people would not do such a thing, and his decision is nullified by the rest of the world's opinions. However, if he puts straw and abandons it, or better yet, he spreads dirt - this helps, and his sukkah becomes valid.
