Yoma 46 - The fourth pyre The fourth pyre on the Altar - which was only required according to Rabbi Meir - was for burning the limbs of the daily offering on those days when some were left from the previous night. It was fired even on Shabbat, and therein lies the problem: lighting fire on Shabbat is prohibited. We understand that the Temple service overrides this rule, but to what extent? Therefore, Rav Avin qualified it: the pyre is started even for invalid (such as ritually impure) parts, but only if a fire had singed them.
