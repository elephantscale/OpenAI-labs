 However, Rabbi Chiya, his nephew, taught Torah in public, to two great relatives of his: Rav and Rabbah bar bar Chanah. Rabbi Yehudah heard and was upset. Rabbi Chiya went to visit him, and Rabbi Yehudah said, "Iya, who is calling you outside?" This was a derogatory name, and Rabbi Chiya understood that his uncle was upset, so he conducted himself as if he were excommunicated, for thirty days.
