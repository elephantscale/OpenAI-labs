 We can understand the Sages, but how does Rabbi Meir arrive at his point of view, and why does he not include the likeness of a fish? Some say, this is because the term "created" was used in conjunction with human and with animals. But "created" is also used in "And God created large sea creatures!?" - This is a difficulty that the Talmud explains by analyzing the use of the extra word, "created" in different context. Other say, this is because animal eyes resemble those of humans.
