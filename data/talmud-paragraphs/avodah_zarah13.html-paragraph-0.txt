Avodah Zarah 13 - Buying in a Shop of an Idolater If in a city, on the day when they celebrate their deity, some shops are decorated and some are not, then buying in the decorated shops is prohibited, while buying in non-decorated shops is permitted. One can assume that the owners of non-decorated shops do not participate in the festivities.
