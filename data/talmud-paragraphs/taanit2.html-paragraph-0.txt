Taanit 2 - Three keys In the prayer, there is a place to mention the power of God to give rain, and there is also another place to actually ask for rain. When should one say these? Rabbi Eliezer says that one should mention rain from the beginning of Sukkot, which marks the beginning of the rainy season. Rabbi Yehoshua asked, "A rain is bad on Sukkot, because one is trying to live in a sukkah!?" Rather, one should begin to pray for rain on the last day of Sukkot.
