 Rav Yehudah said, "The souring wine that is sold in shops still retains the blessing over wine, that is, "Who created the fruit of the vine." Rav Zevid said, "Why should I say a blessing over wine that has soured? Rather, the blessing is "Who created everything by His word." Rav Yehudah agrees about wine sold on the corners, which the thirsty indiscriminate public consumes in haste, that it is not wine at all.
