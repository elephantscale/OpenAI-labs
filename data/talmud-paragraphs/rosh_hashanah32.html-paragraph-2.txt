 With all the importance of the shofar, one may not do the following to bring it on Rosh Hashanah: carry it from afar, ride a horse, dig it up from the rubble, nor swim in water for it. One may clean it with water or wine. If a child wants to play the shofar, not only he is not stopped, but they help him learn, even on Shabbat.
