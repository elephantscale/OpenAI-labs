 Where did the Torah say so? Talking about a Passover sacrifice, it says, "Don't leave any of it until morning, and what is left of it until morning should be burned in fire." The word "morning" is repeated because it is refers not to the morning after Passover nigh, which is still a Yom Tov, but to the next morning, which is already a weekday, and only then can unfit sacrifice be burned. We learn from here a general rule of not burning unfit holy items on a Yom Tov. Another way to explain this is that only that which is to be eaten by people on a Yom Tov itself can be put on fire, but anything which can be burned later should be burned later.
