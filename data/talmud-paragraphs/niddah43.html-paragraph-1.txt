 Thus, if a Kohen was eating his holy portion (terumah), and he felt his limbs trembling, he grasps the male organ, to prevent semen from exiting his body, and quickly swallows the terumah food. But how could he do it? We learned that one should not touch his member!? Abaye answered, "He grasps it with a thick cloth, as it does not cause additional arousal." Rava said, "Even thin cloth, since no additional semen will be emitted on account of it," and those with whom it will are anyway a minority.
