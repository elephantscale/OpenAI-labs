Nazir 54 - Not to shave! There are cases when the ritual impurity does not really exist, but it was "decreed by the Sages." Take, for example, a field where a grave was previously located, then the location of it was lost, and then the field was plowed over. Since anyone who is walking through the field can potentially touch a bone and become impure, the Sages said that such a field should be treated as ritually impure, and anyone who went through it without precautions will have to purify himself.
