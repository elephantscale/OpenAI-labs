 Any vessel receptive of impurity from a man who had an emission (zav) sitting on it, is also receptive to the impurity of the dead body. However, the other way around is not true: if a vessel is so large that it is not designated for sitting, it does not become impure when a zav sits on it, since they can tell him "stand up, and let us do our work."
