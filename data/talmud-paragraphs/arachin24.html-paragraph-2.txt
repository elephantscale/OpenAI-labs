 One can consecrate his ancestral field to the Temple, and then redeem it at a fixed price prescribed by the Torah. The price of fifty silver shekels that we mentioned earlier is the maximum price for the 49 nine years until the Jubilee year. Since the field returns to him in the Jubilee year anyway, every year the price is reduced. However, because of a technicality, it is not reduced within the last two years before the Jubilee, and one should therefore be mindful of that when consecrating his field.
