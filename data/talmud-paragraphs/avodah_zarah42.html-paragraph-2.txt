 How do they both explain the story of Dagon? It had a body of a fish and the head, hands, and feet of a human. When they placed it before the Ark of God, its head and palms were severed and the priests then worshipped the threshold on which they landed. Rabbi Yochanan says that they venerated the fragments. And Resh Lakish? - He says that they thought the power abandoned Dagon and settled on the threshold.
