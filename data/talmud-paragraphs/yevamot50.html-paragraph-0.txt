Yevamot 50 - Divorce, and then another divorce If a deceased brother left two wives, and the remaining brother gives each one a Get (divorce document), then the second Get has no validity. Really, the Get has no place here; it should be either a yibum (marriage) or a chalitzah, which is akin to divorce. However, if he does give the first wife a Get, and the Get has no effect, then certainly the Get given to the second wife has no impact either, and he can marry the second wife's relatives (mother, sister, etc.)
