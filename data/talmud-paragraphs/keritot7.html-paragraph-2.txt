 Sin offerings are not necessarily brought for inadvertent serious mistakes; sometimes they are brought in the course of regular life. If a woman miscarried a child, she has to bring a regular sin-offering, the meat of which is eaten by the Kohanim; if she aborted, but it is not known if the fetus was normal, she brings an offering which is not eaten; and one who aborts on the fortieth day after conception or earlier does not bring any sacrifice.
