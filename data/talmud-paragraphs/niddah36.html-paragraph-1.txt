 However, before the law changed, if a woman was giving birth not in the days when she become a niddah, then her blood does not automatically make her impure.

If, however, she sees blood while giving birth, and then the labor stops, this tells us that the blood was not due to imminent childbirth, and she is ritually impure as a zavah.
