 A sanhedrin that executes once in seven years is called a destroyer. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azaryah says, "Once is seventy years." Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say, "Had we been on the sanhedrin at the time when they still performed executions, no person would ever been executed." Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "They would just increase the number of murderers in Israel," because they would have eliminated the criminals' fear of retribution.
