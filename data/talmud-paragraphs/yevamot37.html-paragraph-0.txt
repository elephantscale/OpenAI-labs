Yevamot 37 - Yibum with a pregnant widow If a woman's husband dies and leaves no son, the late husband's brother can do a yibum (marriage) or a chalitzah (divorce) with the widow. However, the Sages asked to delay either for three months. Here is why. Imagine that one marries the late brother's wife only two months after the brother dies. Imagine also that she gives birth seven months after this. Now we have two possibilities. It could be that this child is the full-term baby of the deceased. In this case, yibum was forbidden in the first place, they have transgressed and must bring a sacrifice, and he needs to divorce her because one cannot live with the wife of this brother who died but left a child.
