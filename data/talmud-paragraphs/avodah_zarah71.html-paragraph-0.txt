Avodah Zarah 71 - Soldiers in the City If a troop of soldiers entered a city and came into a Jews house, then the status of the wine is determined as follows: if this occurred during peacetime, then any open barrels found there are prohibited, while sealed ones are permitted. The opened barrels are prohibited because of their possible contact with the marauding soldiers. The sealed barrels, though, are permitted, because the soldiers, being afraid of no one, would not bother resealing the barrels they had broken into. If this occurred during wartime, then both open and sealed barrels are permitted, because the soldiers do not have time to make libations to idols.
