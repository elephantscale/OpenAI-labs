Beitzah 5 - Why do we observe two days of Yom Tov? Even though the appearance of the moon, and hence the beginning of the new month, was calculated by the Sanhedrin, they would not announce it until witnesses testified that they saw the new moon. Once the official day beginning the month was known, all Holidays: Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur, etc., were set.
