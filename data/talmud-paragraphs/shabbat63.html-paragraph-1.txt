Just as a sword is always ready, so should be your learning, and this ability to recall it at will is your glory and splendor." Then Mar, the son of Rav Huna, told him, "You may be right, and learning is the main import of this phrase, but what about the rule that a literal meaning of any verse is never completely discarded!?"
