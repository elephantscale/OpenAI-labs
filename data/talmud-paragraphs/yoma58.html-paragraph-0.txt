Yoma 58 - The ox and the goat Having brought incense into the Holy of Holies, the High Priest (whose each action atones for some specific mistakes of the Jewish people) directs his steps to the golden Altar inside the Sanctuary to atone for the defect in this Altar's service throughout the year. He takes the blood of the ox and the goat and applies it to the four corners (slight protrusions, also called "horns" of the Altar.) Rabbi Yoshiyah says that he mixes the two types of blood in a vessel - based on the words "One application in a year." However, Rabbi Yonatan says that the "and" in the "ox and goat" teaches two separate applications. Each one then needs to find an explanation for the Torah words used in his opponent's derivation.
