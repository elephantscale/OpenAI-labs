 This, however, leads to many questions. How could they marry wives in many places - what if their children, not knowing each other, will intermarry? - Those Sages were famous, and their progeny would know where they came from. Another problem: a prospective wife needs to go to a mikveh seven days in advance, so how can they choose anybody on the spot? - The answer is that they would send a messenger to announce their intent a week in advance. Alternatively, we can say that they only secluded with the woman of their choice but did not have relations, thus obviating all of the above questions. But if that is so, how did it help? - One who potentially has a wife ("a bread in his basket") cannot be compared to one who does not.
