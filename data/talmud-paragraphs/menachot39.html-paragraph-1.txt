 The Torah said, "You shall not wear shaatnez, wool and linen together. [But] You shall make yourself braided fringes on the four corners of your garments." This teaches that although shaatnez is forbidden, in tzitzit it is allowed. Moreover, one cannot say that the linen and wool are simply put together, because the tzitzit must have at least one double knot, which makes it permanently attached, and thus part to the garment.
