Eruvin 63 - Respect for one's teacher As a sign of respect, the student should not render decisions in matters of Torah law in the town or vicinity of his teacher, but should rather defer the question to his teacher's judgment. This was especially applicable in the times of the Talmud, because often a student would receive all of his Torah knowledge from one teacher, rather than from a school or from multiple published books, and also because the Sages of the Talmud were on a very high level of personal integrity and actually fulfilled in their lives what they taught in their lessons.
