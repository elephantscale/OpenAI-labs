Gittin 54 - Penalizing for transgressions If one mistakenly violates a Rabbinical prohibition, should he be penalized? Rabbi Meir says, "Yes, because people in general take Rabbinical decrees lightly, and therefore they should be upheld all the more." Rabbi Yehudah says, "No, Rabbinical prohibitions carry less weight than those of the Torah, therefore additional penalties are not justified."
