Sukkah 35 - Etrog, or citron Etrog (citron) is one of the species in the Sukkot bunch. However, since it is special in that it has taste and smell, its requirements are more strict. For example, the laws of orlah (fruit that is not eaten for the first three years) apply to it, and thus an etrog in the first three years is invalid. Technically, this is because, by law, it will be burned and thus is considered to have zero measurements even now.
