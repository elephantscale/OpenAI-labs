Zevachim 91 - Digression: Laws of Flour and Oil Offerings Said Rabbi Shimon, "If you see Kohanim who are distributing oil in the Temple Courtyard, you don't have to ask what it is. It is either the remainder of a wafer flour-offering of a regular Jew, or the remainder of the oil of a metzora, a spiritual leper. (Only Rabbi Shimon thinks so, but the Sages say that the oil was smeared on the wafer until none remained.)
