 Rabbi Eliezer says, "Let the kohen place all these limbs on the Altar, and I view the sin-offering (which is not supposed to be burned) as if it were mere wood." But the Sages say that the limbs must be left until the next morning, when they become invalidated as "leftovers", and then they can be burned together with all other invalidated offerings, in a place specially designated for this.
