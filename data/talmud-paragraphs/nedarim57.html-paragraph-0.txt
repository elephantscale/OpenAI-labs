Nedarim 57 - I am not eating this fruit! If one vows that he will not eat specific fruit or that they are forbidden to him like a sacrifice, then even if he exchanges them for something else, or if something grows from them, this, too, is forbidden. When he compared his prohibition to sacrifice, he implied the same laws. Just as for a sacrifice - its exchange and its fruit (offspring) are forbidden - so too the fruit he forbade on himself.
