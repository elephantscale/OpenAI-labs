 Rav Zeira once found Rav Yehudah (a usually austere Sage) at the door of his father-in-law in such a lighthearted mood that if Rav Zeira were to ask him any question in the world, Rav Yehudah would tell him. Rav Zeira asked multiple questions, such as "Why goats always walk in front of the flock?" - Because darkness always precedes light, just as in the creation of the world. "Why are sheep's hindquarters covered with a tail, but goat's aren't" - Because people cover themselves with shearing of the sheep, but not of goats".
