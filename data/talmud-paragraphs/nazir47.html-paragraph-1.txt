 What if a High Priest and a nazir find this corpse together - who is obligated to bury this dead and thus preserve the other one from becoming impure? This should be the High Priest because to purify himself, he only needs to wait for seven days and get himself sprinkled with the ashes of the Red Heifer. By contrast, a nazir would need to bring special sacrifices before he can restart being a nazir. This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Sages say just the opposite. Nazir should bury because his limitations are temporary, whereas the High Priest should always be pure.
