Brachot 30 - One Who hears prayer One who travels in a dangerous place can say a very short prayer. What is its text? Rabbi Yehoshua says, "Save, O God, Your nation, the remnant of Israel; at every cross-roads (meaning, even if they are crossing You) may their needs be before You. Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer." Rabbi Eliezer says, "Grant peace of mind to those who fear You; do to them what's right in Your eyes (but don't punish them through others, more than needed). Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer." Others say, "The needs of Your nation Israel are many, but their minds are limited to express them; may it be Your will to give to everyone enough for his sustenance. Blessed are You, God, who hears prayer."
