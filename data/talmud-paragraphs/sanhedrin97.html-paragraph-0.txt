Sanhedrin 97 - The Generation at the Time of the Mashiach and The Age of the World In the generation when the son of David (Mashiach) will come, the meeting place of the scholars will be used for licentiousness, the wisdom of the scholars will decay, those who fear sin will be despised, and the face of the generation will be like the face of a dog. The truth will be absent, as in "And the truth will be absent, and he that turns away from evil will become foolish."
