Pesachim 22 - Not eating and not using Not only chametz cannot be eaten on Passover, but one also should not derive from it any benefit, such as selling. Where does it say so in the Torah? - The words "It will not be eaten" are understood to mean, "You shall not do anything with it that can lead to eating."
