Pesachim 75 - Instructions on cooking and eating the Passover lamb Since the Passover offering must be "roasted over fire," one must be careful when cooking. If they notice that the meat has touched the earthenware part of the oven while cooking, they need to scrape this part off. In this place, it was roasted due to the oven wall's heat, not open fire.
