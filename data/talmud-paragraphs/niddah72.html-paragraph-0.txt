Niddah 72 - Eleventh Day After the seven days of niddah, a woman immerses herself in a mikveh, and the couple can resume normal marital relations. During the next eleven days, if she sees blood, she is not called a niddah, but a zavah. Now she only has to wait for one day, and immerse in the mikveh the next morning. However, if she sees blood on the following day, the two days now combine, and her immersion in nullified. Therefore, the correct behavior in the eleven days of the zivah period is to wait until the end of the following day, and immerse in the mikveh then.
