 If he did not mark the tenth one with red dye, did not count them with a staff, or did not pass them through a narrow exit, but counted them as they were crouching or standing, they are still tithed, since the Torah said, "And the tenth one will be holy" - even when the correct procedure is not followed. However, if he just ten out of a hundred or one out of ten, without counting all - it is not tithe, because the Torah said "tenth", but not "ten". Rabbi Yose ben Yehudah says that it is tithed even in that case, since the Torah said, "It will be considered to you as tithe" - a mental consideration is sufficient.
