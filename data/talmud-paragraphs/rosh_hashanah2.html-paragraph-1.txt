 The New Year for the (Jewish) kings starts on the first day of the month of Nisan. If a king ascended the throne even one day before Nisan, this is still considered the first year of his reign, and on the first of Nisan, they begin counting his second year. This year is then used in business documents, such as loan notes, to honor the king.
