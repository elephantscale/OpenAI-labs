Menachot 15 - The Other Part of an Invalidated Offering If one part of the two flour offerings discussed previously - Shavuot and Bread of Vision - became ritually impure, then what should be done with the remaining valid part? Rabbi Yehudah says that it should be burned, because it does not have its companion part, but the Sages maintain that only the invalid part is burned in a special place designated as "the place of burning," but the remaining pure part can be eaten.
