 One who sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow must write for him a document of sale, which states, "Acquire the promissory note and whatever lien is in it." If he did not do so, the buyer acquired only the paper on which it is written, for use such as a bottle-stopper. The sale would then become void because of the law against overcharge.
