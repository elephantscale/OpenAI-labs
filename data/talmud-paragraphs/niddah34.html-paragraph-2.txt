 The semen of a Jew is ritually impure, and if it comes out of an idolatress, it makes her impure. The semen of a non-Jew is pure, and if it comes out of a Jewish woman, it does not make her impure. Rav Pappa asked the question about the semen of a Jew inside of an idolatress. But we just answered it!? He meant, after three days. We know that inside a Jewish woman it putrefies in three days and is thus pure, perhaps because she is always worried about mitzvot, which adds internal heat. This is not true about an idolatress. On the other hand, an idolatress eats various crawling creatures, and maybe that too adds heat? The question remained unresolved.
