 It was customary to mark graves with lime so that those eating the priestly portion (terumah) would stay away and not become ritually impure. One of the hints for this custom is in the words of Ezekiel, "When one sees a human bone, he will make a marker near it." (Ezekiel was talking about the soldiers of the army of Gog). The Talmud quotes many other allusions to this custom.
