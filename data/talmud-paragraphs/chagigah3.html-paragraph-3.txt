 What does it mean that "The words of the wise are as goads and as nails well-planted... given by one Shepherd"? - That just like goads direct a cow in the field, so the words of the Torah direct people to good ways of life. Why are they fastened steady like nails? The difference is this. Nails take away from the wall. By contrast, mitzvot are "planted" and give back to those who observe them. Finally, they all come from one Master, and even though the Sages disagree, one can still find a correct way.
