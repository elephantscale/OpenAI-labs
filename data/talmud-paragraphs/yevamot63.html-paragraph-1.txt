 As Rav was leaving Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Chiya asked him, "What is worse than death?" Rav searched for the answer and found it, "I found - bitter than death - a bad wife." Rabbi Chiya intended to save Rav from a bad wife, but his prayer was unsuccessful, and Rav's wife used to aggravate him, cooking the opposite of what he asked. Rav's son, Chiya, started reversing Rav's requests so that when the wife cooked a different dish, Rav would get precisely what he wanted. Rav said, "Your mother has improved her ways!" Chiya confessed that he was reversing orders. Rav said, "I could have learned from you! And yet, it is not good to say a lie."
