Menachot 62 - How Waving Is Performed Both the owner of the sacrifice and the priest are mentioned as doing the waving. How is this accomplished? The priest places his hands below the hands of the owner and waves the portions. If there is bread to go with the sacrifice, it is placed on top of the other portions, just as they did at the Inauguration service in the desert.
