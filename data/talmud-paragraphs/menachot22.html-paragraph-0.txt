Menachot 22 - Using Communal Wood, Mixing Handfuls When one brings his personal sacrifices, he gets to use the Temple wood, bought with communal funds. For you might think that he needs to bring his own wood, just as he brings his own libations. To dispel this notion, the Torah said, "On the wood that is on the fire that is on the Altar." Just as the Altar comes from the communal funds, so too the fire and the wood.
