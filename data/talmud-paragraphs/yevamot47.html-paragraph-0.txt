Yevamot 47 - Accepting converts A man came to Rav Yehudah and said, "Even though everybody considers me Jewish, the truth is that I have converted myself, without the presence of a court of three." Rav Yehudah asked, "Do you have children?" The man answered, "yes." Rabbi Yehudah then said, "You are believed to disqualify yourself from being Jewish, but not to disqualify your children."
