 What is the Torah's proof? Just as the days of the mother's purity after giving birth to a female are eighty days, so too is the formation of a fetus, while it is forty days for a male. And the Sages? They say, "You cannot compare the formation of a fetus to the laws of ritual purity." What did Rabbi Ishmael answer to the experiment? He said, "Perhaps the woman with the female was pregnant from before." The Sages said, "Cleopatra appointed a guardian for her!" Rabbi Ishmael answered, "There is no guardian against promiscuity."
