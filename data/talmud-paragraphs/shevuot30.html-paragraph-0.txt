Shevuot 30 - The Oath of Testimony The oath of testimony concerns witnesses who knew testimony that a litigant needs in order to win a monetary case. If the litigant asks them to testify, and they falsely swear that they do not know the testimony, they are liable to bring a "variable" offering when they admit that they lied. If the litigant has other means to win the case, or he has other witnesses, the liability for false oath does not apply.
