Meilah 30 - Temple Morning (Tamid) After the Kohanim enter the Chamber of Hewn Stone, the appointed Kohen tells them, "Come and cast lots for the services: Who slaughters the morning daily offering? Who throws its blood on the Altar? Who clears the ashes of the Inner Altar? Who clears the ash from the Menorah? Who brings the limbs of the morning offering to the ramp of the Altar?"
