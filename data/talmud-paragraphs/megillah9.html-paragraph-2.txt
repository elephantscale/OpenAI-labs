 Other books can be written in other languages - but Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagrees and allows, among all foreign languages, only Greek. Why Greek? Because of the story of the king Ptolemy, who sequestered seventy-two Sages in seventy-two houses, and commanded them to translate the Torah into Greek. Without communication, they translated word for word, and made occasional emendations in the same places. They changed the name of God from plural into singular, such as instead of "let us make man," - "let Me make man." They also changed the "rabbit" into "creature with short legs," because Ptolemy's wife was called "rabbit," and the Sages did not want Ptolemy to think that the Jews were mocking him by inserting the name of his wife among non-kosher animals.
