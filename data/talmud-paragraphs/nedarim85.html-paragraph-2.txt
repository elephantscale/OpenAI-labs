 If a woman is upset with her husband and makes a vow that the product of her work will be forbidden to him, the vow does not take effect - because he is entitled to this product. However, Rabbi Akiva says that he better revoke it anyway: she might make more than required, and that would actually be forbidden to him. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri gives another reason for annulling such a vow: what if he divorces her? - Not being able to revoke the vow now, he would be unable to re-marry her.
