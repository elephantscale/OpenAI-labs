Brachot 59 - Blessings for all occasions When one sees unusually formed creatures, he should pronounce the blessing of "Blessed are You... Who diversifies the creatures," and on seeing very beautiful creatures or trees he says "Blessed are You... Who has such in His world." On strong winds, hurricanes and earthquakes one says, "Blessed are You... Whose strength and power fills the world."
