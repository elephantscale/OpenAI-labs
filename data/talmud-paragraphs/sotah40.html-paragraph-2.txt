 Rabbi Abbahu said, "Initially, I used to say these phrases during the blessing of the Kohanim. But once I saw Rabbi Abba from Akko being silent, I also stopped talking." Rabbi Abbahu continued, "I thought that I had real humility. But once I observed the following behavior of Rabbi Abba. He was delivering a lecture to a large audience, and his helper - whose task was to repeat the lesson in a loud voice and explain it - was giving different explanations for the same points as Rabbi Abba mentioned. Nevertheless, Rabbi Abba said nothing to him! Compared to him, I do not have humility."
