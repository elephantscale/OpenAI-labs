Eruvin 55 - How Moses taught In order to completely understand the next portion of what later became the Talmud, Moses first learned it four time from God. Then Aaron would enter the tent of Moses, sit right across him, and Moses would teach him the portion. Then Aaron would sit to the side of Moses, the two sons of Aaron would enter, and Moses taught them. Then the rest of the Sages would come in, and Moses taught them. Then the rest of the people were taught by Moses.
