 These offerings are slaughtered anywhere in the Courtyard, and their blood requires only one application on the Altar, provided that it is done against the foundation. The foundation is the one-cubit step at the bottom of the Altar; it ran along the western and northern sides, plus another cubit to the east and to the south sides.
