Bechorot 34 - Blemish Caused on Purpose If one intentionally blemished the ear of a firstborn animal, Rabbi Eliezer forbids the slaughter based on this and on all future blemishes, since without this future penalty the person has nothing to loose: he could not slaughter it before and can't slaughter now. However, if we penalize him for the future, that will stop him. The Sages also forbid the slaughter based on this blemish, but they do allow it should a new, unrelated blemish occur. The Sages penalize him just for what he did, but not for the future.
