 Anyone who planted a vineyard and has not used it (this includes three years of it being "orlah" and the fourth year after that) - goes back. And anyone who has engaged to a woman but did not get married to her - goes back to his wife and spends a year with her. Finally, anyone who is scared also goes back. He may feel that he did something wrong, and therefore he does not have the merit to win in war. Other reasons are mentioned first so that people who are afraid do not have to be humiliated by admitting it.
