 With all that we said about the Torah on the previous pages, how could God say, "I, too, will give you laws that are not good?" Rabbi Yochanan says that it is talking about someone who is learning, but does not express his joy of learning in singing. However Abaye asked about this, "Just because someone does not know how to sing nicely, he deserves the bad words?" Rather, it is talking about two Sages who live in the same city but do not discuss Torah between them.
