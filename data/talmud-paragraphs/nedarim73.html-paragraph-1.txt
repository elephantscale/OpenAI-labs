 Let us try to approach this question from another side. A deaf husband cannot annul his wife's vows, because "and the husband hears..." cannot be fulfilled. Does it mean that a regular husband also needs to hear the vow? - Perhaps not: a deaf husband cannot hear at all, that is why "and the husband hears..." is impossible, so he cannot annul. However, if he can hear, then maybe actual hearing is not required.
