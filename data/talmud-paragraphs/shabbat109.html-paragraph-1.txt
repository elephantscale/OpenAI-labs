 Generally it is prohibited to effect cure of minor diseases on Shabbat. The Sages accepted this decree due to the possibility that one may come to grind medicine on Shabbat, which would definitely be prohibited. However, if he eats foods that have therapeutic effect, but that are generally eaten also by healthy people, then it is not obvious that he does it for healing, and it is allowed.
