 A mikveh is a pool of rainwater used for ritual purification. If some water is poured into it from a vessel, before it collects the required volume of rainwater, it becomes disqualified. How much poured water would disqualify it? Hillel says that it is a hin (faithfully using the word "hin"that his teaches used), or about a gallon (because one can wash himself in that), and Shammai is much more lenient and says that is it nine kavin, about four gallons (because this is enough for a shower). The other Sages are stricter than both and say that it is three lugs (about one quart).
