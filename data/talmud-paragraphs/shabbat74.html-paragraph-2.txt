 Rav Yosef took issue with that, "How can it be allowed to performed forbidden labor in small amounts?" Rather, he is allowed to select with the hand, but not with an implement, such as a funnel. Rav Hamnuna challenged this also: "Does the rule mention anything about a funnel?" Rather, one can select good food and eat, but not bad food and leave it, similar to pebbles and grain! Abaye argued in turn, "Does the rule mention anything about good food and bad food?" Rather, he may select and eat immediately, or give to others to eat now; however, he may not select and leave for later, and if he did, it is as if he selected for storage, and that is prohibited.
