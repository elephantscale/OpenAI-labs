Menachot 108 - One Who Forgot What Sacrifice He Promised If one said, "I promise to bring a burned offering" but did not say which one, he brings a lamb. Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says that he brings a turtledove or a pigeon. They do not argue in principle, but in the place where one lived lambs were cheaper, and where Rabbi Elazar lived, birds were less expensive.
