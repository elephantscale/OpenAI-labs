Sanhedrin 60 - Idol Worship Liability One is liable for idol worship if he serves an idol in its usual way, that is, does any action that is the normal manner of worship for a particular idol, including embracing and kissing, etc., and even a disgraceful act. Additionally, one is liable is he performs one of the four services used in the Temple: slaughters an offering, burns an offering, pours a libation, or bows down to an idol, even if that is not its usual manner of service. One is also liable if he accepts the idol upon himself as a deity, or says to it, "You are my god."
