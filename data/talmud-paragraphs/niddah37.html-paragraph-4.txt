 Rav Assi became sick, going from heat to cold and back, and ultimately passed away. Shila said to his wife, "Prepare burial shrouds for me, as I must leave the world along with Rav Assi, so that he should not go to Rav alone and tell him derogatory things about me," then he too passed away. At the burial, the biers of the two scholars were side by side, and people saw myrtle branch fly back and forth from one bier to the other, and said, "We see that the Sages made a reconciliation."
