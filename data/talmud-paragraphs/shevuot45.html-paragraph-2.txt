 What is the case of a storekeeper with his ledger? If an employer tells the storekeeper, "Give my workers two selah in small change," and the shopkeeper says, "It is written in my ledger that I gave as you instructed," but the workers say, "We did not take anything from the storekeeper," they both swear and collect the payment from the employer.
