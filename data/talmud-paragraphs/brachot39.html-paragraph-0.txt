Brachot 39 - A whole loaf or slices of better quality Two students were sitting at a meal in front of Bar Kappara. They brought before them cooked cabbage and partridge meat. Bar Kappara gave permission to one of the to say the blessing; the student rushed and said the blessing on the partridge, and his colleague mocked him. Bar Kappara became angry and said, "I am not angry with the one who said the blessing, but with the one who mocked. If you friend looks like one who never tasted meat in his life, is that a reason to mock?" Then he said, "I am not angry with the one who mocked, but with the one who wrongly recited the blessing. Even if I am not wise, at least I am older, and he should have asked." Both students did not live out the year.
