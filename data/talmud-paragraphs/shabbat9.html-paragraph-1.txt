 Actually, there are two time limits for the Afternoon prayer: one can first say it already half an hour after midday, but the ideal time corresponds to the last afternoon sacrifice in the Temple, and it starts at three and a half hours after midday, closer to sundown. Which of the two time limits did our rule mean? If we say that it meant the early afternoon prayer, then why? - there is enough time left in the day!
