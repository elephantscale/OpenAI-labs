 In general, four events deserve a blessing: crossing a sea, a desert, being sick and recovering, and being in prison and then released. All of these cases are described in psalm 107. The blessing should be said in the presence of ten people, two of them being Torah scholars, because the psalm says, "Praise Him in the assembly of wise elders."
