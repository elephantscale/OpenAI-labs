Niddah 43 - Seed That Shoots Like Arrow As we mentioned earlier, one who emits seed, as well as one who has a "zivah" type of emission, is only impure once the emission leaves his body. What is the source for this law? The Torah said about him, "Any man who will have a discharge from his flesh..." - from his flesh and not in his flesh, to tell us that it has to be out "from his flesh."
