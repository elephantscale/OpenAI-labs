Shevuot 35 - Various Verbiages of Oath There are five cases when there is no liability for the false oath of testimony: where one testifies to a promise, not actual giving of money; where he adjures them to testify when they will know the testimony in the future; where he addressed himself to a whole group of people, without specifying the witnesses; where their testimony would be hearsay or otherwise invalid; where he sent his slave to adjure the witnesses, or if it was the defendant, not the claimant, who adjured them.
