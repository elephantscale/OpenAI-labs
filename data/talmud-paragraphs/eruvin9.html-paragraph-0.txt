Eruvin 9 - A crossbeam on two pegs If one did not put his crossbeam as it he should, on the two walls where the alley goes into the street, but instead he placed it a little into the street, supported by two pegs, what is the law? Does the beam help to permit carrying on Shabbat in the alley or it does not?
