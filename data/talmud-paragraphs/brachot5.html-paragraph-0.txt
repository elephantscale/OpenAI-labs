Brachot 5 - Prayer Shema at Bedtime Even though one says the Shema in the synagogue during the evening prayer, it is still a mitzvah to recite it again before going to sleep. Why? The psalm says, "Reflect in your hearts while on your beds, and then be silent." Resh Lakish sees another lesson here: a man should constantly agitate his good thoughts against the bad ones ("Agitate and don't sin"); if he removes the bad, good, but if not - let him study Torah ("reflect in your hearts"); if he wins, good, if not - let him say the Shema ("on your beds"); if that does not help, he should remind himself of the day of death ("be silent").
