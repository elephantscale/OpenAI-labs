 A practitioner of Ov is a necromancer - one who communicates with the dead - by raising the spirit of the deceased from the ground and causing it to take up residence under his armpits, from where its voice emanates. A practitioner of Yidoni takes a bone of the animal known as Yadua and places it in his mouth, from where a voice then emanates. These are both liable to stoning, and one who inquires of them violates a negative commandment.
