Zevachim 92 - Washing Garments in the Courtyard The Torah says that the blood of a sin-offering has special laws, because it cannot leave the Courtyard. Thus, if its blood spattered on a priestly garment, that garment must be laundered in water right in the Courtyard. If the offering was cooked in a earthenware vessel, the vessel must be shattered, and if it was a metal vessel, it must be purged. Also, any food that touches the meat of a sin-offering and absorbs its flavor assumes the same stringencies as the meat.
