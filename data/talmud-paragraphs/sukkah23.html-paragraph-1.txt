 If he makes it on a ship, it is valid too. It once happened that Rabbi Akiva and Rabban Gamliel were traveling on a ship, and Rabbi Akiva made his sukkah on top of it. The following day a wind blew and toppled the sukkah. Said Rabban Gamliel, "Akiva, where is your sukkah now?" However, he was not taunting; rather, in Rabban Gamliel's view, a sukkah on top of a ship is invalid. Why? - Because it cannot withstand the strong sea winds, and is thus as if non-existent. If so, what does Rabbi Akiva answer? - He says that if it could stand on land, that is enough permanence, which is valid.
