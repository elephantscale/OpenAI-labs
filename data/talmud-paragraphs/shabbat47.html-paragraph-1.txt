 Rabbi Assi was confounded for a moment, and then said, "Here too we are dealing with a censer that has granules of unburned incense! They are not muktzeh, and the censer can be carried because of them." However, Abaye rejected this explanation: "Granules are not considered as anything in the household of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Rather, Rabbi Yehudah wanted the unpleasant censer moved away." Rava, in turn, rejected this: "Censer is not repugnant, and besides, the ashes in a censer are covered. Rather, the ashes themselves were planned to be used on Shabbat, for covering dirt, and that is why they were not muktzeh, in fact, they were the important part, even if the rest was muktzeh."
