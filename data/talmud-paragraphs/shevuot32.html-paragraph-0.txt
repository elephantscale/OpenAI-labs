Shevuot 32 - Multiple Oaths If one adjured the witnesses five times outside the court, and they denied knowing testimony, and then they came to court and admitted that they did know the testimony, they are not liable at all. A denial issued outside a court is not legally significant. However, if they denied knowing testimony in court, they are liable for each and every time they were adjured. Their single denial applies to each adjuration separately, and thus they are liable to bring five offerings.
