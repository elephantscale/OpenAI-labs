Pesachim 51 - Wrong customs Earlier, we learned that one should follow the customs of the place he came to and not deviate from them to avoid disagreements. However, here is an example of a custom adopted by the unlearned masses on their own: the people of Chozai separated the kohen's portion (challah) from dough made of rice. This is not required at all, and Rav Yosef wanted to send a non-kohen who would eat such "challah" in front of them, thus proving that their custom had no validity. Abaye wanted to stop him, using our previous rule to not deviate from an existing custom. However, Rav Yosef replied that this does not apply to a wrong custom adapted by unlearned masses.
