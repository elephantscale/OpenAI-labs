Sukkah 8 - Sun and shade A sukkah must give some shade; otherwise, it is not considered shelter (the literal meaning of the word "sukkah"). How much? The roof, called "s'chach," should be thick enough to block out more than half the sun. What if the makeshift walls don't go all the way to the roof and therefore let in the sun? - That does not matter. However, Rabbi Yoshiyah says that just as in a normal house, the walls protect and shade you, so they must not let too much sun in the sukkah.
