Pesachim 43 - Perhaps women can eat chametz on Passover? Women and men are equally included in all prohibitions of the Torah, based on the verse "When a man or a woman sins against a fellow, thus being untrue to God...". However, according to Rabbi Eliezer, they might still be permitted to eat chametz on Pesach. Why? Since the Torah said, "Do not eat any leaven, seven days eat matzah." Now we know that women are free from any Torah commandment that has a fixed time for doing it due to their busy schedules. This would include eating matzah since it is applicable only on the seven days of Passover. And once they don't have to eat matzah, the "do not eat leaven" should not apply to them either.
