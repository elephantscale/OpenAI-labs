 Rava was so careful with even numbers that he mentally counted the cups he drank by marking the roof's beams in this house. Abaye, after he would drink the first cup, his mother would right away give him two more, one in each hand. One man divorced his wife, and she then married a shop owner. Every day he would come to this shop to drink wine but was very careful to count his cups and never drank an even number. Once, however, he lost count after sixteen and left, having drunk an even number; she performed witchcraft, and he burst.
