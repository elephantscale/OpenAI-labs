 The loaves that had to be leaved presented a special problem. Ordinarily one adds some sourdough to hasten the leavening process. In case of sacrifices, the measure had to be exact, and additional sourdough would make it invalid. Rabbi Meir suggests to take out some flour, allow it to leaven, then return it to the offering. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees, since leavening in this case would not be perfect. Rather, one has to put in sourdough and then add flour to complete the measure. The Sages, however, say that in that way too the offering would be either deficient or excessive, because the water in the sourdough would distort the measurements.
