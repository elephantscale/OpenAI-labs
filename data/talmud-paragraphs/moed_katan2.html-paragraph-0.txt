Moed Katan 2 - Limiting the work Both Passover and Sukkot holidays last for seven days. The first day is a Yom Tov when work is completely prohibited. The last day is also a Yom Tov. The five intermediate days are called "holiday weekdays" between the first and the last Yom Tov. On these days, work is permitted, but it is limited - thus adding to the enjoyment of the holidays.
