Shabbat 6 - Four areas for Shabbat One is not allowed to transfer objects from a private domain to a public domain and vice versa, on Shabbat. If he does so unwittingly, then, once he realizes his mistake, he has to bring a sacrifice. If he does it consciously and there are witnesses who tell him not to do it, he is liable to stoning, and if there are no witnesses, he may be cut off from his spiritual source. What is considered private domain for this purpose? One's house qualifies, but even any area bigger than four by four hand-breadths and surrounded by walls, or partitions, is also considered private. What is considered a public area? Any highway, a large public plaza, a street that is not delimited by doors from both sides, and any place where multitudes walk.
