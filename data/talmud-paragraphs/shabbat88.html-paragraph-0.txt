Shabbat 88 - The "marriage" between God and the people of Israel Why, while receiving the Torah, the Jews "stood under the mountain"? - Because God overturned the mountain as a vat and told them, "If you accept the Torah, all is well, but if not - this will be your grave." Rav Acha said, "This is a great argument of compulsion under duress for one who does not observe the Torah." However, Rava took the argument away by mentioning that at Purim time the Jews accepted the Torah again, this time without coercion.
