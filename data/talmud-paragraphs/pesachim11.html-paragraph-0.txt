Pesachim 11 - When one missed his search for chametz If one missed the right time (night of the fourteenth of Nissan) to search for chametz, what is he to do? Rabbi Yehudah says that he can search in the morning of the next day, and even later, until midday, up until the time when chametz becomes prohibited. However, the Sages allow one search in the morning, and in the appointed time, and even after that. Why does Rabbi Yehudah stop the search after the chametz becomes forbidden? - Because he is concerned that people may accidentally put it in their mouths. And the Sages? - They say that since one is looking for chametz to destroy it, he will surely not eat it.
