 By (Torah) law, when one pays money, he acquires the object. The Sages, however, established that movable objects should be acquired by lifting, pulling into one's domain, or taking control over them. Until the buyer takes delivery of his purchase, the seller, who already got paid, may not be careful to protect it. If, however, the object is still the seller's until delivery, he will be careful.
