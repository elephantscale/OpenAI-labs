Chullin 116 - The Rennet The fourth stomach of the ruminants is called abomasum. Its lining contains an enzyme, called rennin, which, when added to milk, causes it to coagulate into cheese. The congealed milk, found in the abomasum of young nursing ruminants, is called rennet. Sometimes the term "rennet" is used to denote the membrane lining the stomach, and sometimes it refers to rennin.
