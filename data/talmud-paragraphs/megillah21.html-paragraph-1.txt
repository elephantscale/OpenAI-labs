 How do we know this rule about reading the Torah? - Because God said to Moses, "And you, stand here with Me." In fact, Rabbi Abahu explained it thus: "Were it not that the Torah said it, it would be inappropriate to speak of God in these terms, but it tells us that God, too, was standing while teaching Moses." From the word "with me," we see that the teacher should be not sitting on the couch while the student is on the ground, but instead, they should be on the same level. Indeed, earlier generations, from Moses till Rabban Gamliel, were standing while learning Torah. Later a general feebleness descended into the world, and they began learning while sitting.
