 Prior to Shabbat, one should not sell any item to a non-Jew, or help him load it, because his subsequent carrying it home may seem as if he is doing this on the behest of a Jew - so say Beit Shammai - unless he can reach his home before Shabbat starts. However, Beit Hillel say that it is enough for him to be able to reach the first house in his town. Then, if he carries it to his home - that is his own affair.
