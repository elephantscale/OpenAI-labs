Menachot 35 - Tefillin The Torah refers to the head tefillin three times, once with an extra letter vav, which teaches that the head tefillin must have four compartments - these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. However, Rabbi Akiva says that this derivation is not needed. Rather, the word for tefillin (totafot) itself hints at the number four, since "tot" means "two" in the Cafti language, and "fot" means "two" in the Afriki language.
