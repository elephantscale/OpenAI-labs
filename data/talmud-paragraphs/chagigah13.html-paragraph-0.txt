Chagigah 13 - How to teach mysteries One should not teach the mystery secrets (of Kabbalah) other than to someone who understands them on his own, and even then, he should only be told subject titles, but not the actual contents in detail. Some say it differently: anybody can be taught general ideas of Kabbalah, but to explain them with particulars - that is only for those who can understand them on their own.
