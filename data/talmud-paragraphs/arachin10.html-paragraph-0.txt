Arachin 10 - Music in the Temple Every day they would blow trumpets in the Temple, no less than twenty-one notes, but no more than forty-eight. The Torah said, "On the days of your joy... sound the trumpets!" Trumpets accompanied opening the gates, then nine sounds came with the morning daily sacrifice, and another nine with the afternoon one. Music started when wine libations began pouring. The forty-eight notes occurred when New Moon was celebrated on a Friday: nine notes were added because of additional offering, nine sounds told people to stop working in the fields, and twelve more notes were sounded if it was also Succot.
