Menachot 27 - What is Essential From here on, for the next few pages, we will be dealing with the question of which parts of the commandments are essential and cannot be omitted. As a general rule, nothing is essential, unless stated otherwise. The Torah can indicate that a requirement is essential by either repeating it, or by using the word "thus," or the word "a decree" when describing it.
