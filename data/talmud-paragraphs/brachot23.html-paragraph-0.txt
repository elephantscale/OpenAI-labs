Brachot 23 - Attending to one's needs If one was saying the Amidah (Standing prayer) and then remembered that he had a seminal emission, he should not stop praying, but rather shorten it, saying the beginning and the end of each of the eighteen blessings. This rule goes back to the time before the lenient opinion of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira was accepted.
