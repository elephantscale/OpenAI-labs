Menachot 51 - The Pancakes of Nobody If the High Priest dies, his daily pancake offering must be brought nevertheless. Under normal circumstances, he pays for them and brings them. Who pays for them now? Rabbi Shimon says: "They are brought from the public funds." Rabbi Yehudah says, "The funds come from his heirs, and in that case the offering was brought whole, not in two halves."
