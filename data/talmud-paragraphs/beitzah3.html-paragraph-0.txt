Beitzah 3 - More takes on the egg Still trying to explain why an egg laid on a Holiday (Yom Tov) should not be eaten, Rabbah says that we need to think of when this egg has completed its growth while inside the hen. This happened on the day before. What if that day was Shabbat? Then we have food being prepared on Shabbat for consumption on a Holiday, and that is forbidden. Why? Because the Torah said, "On Friday they will prepare" - that is, it is on only the weekday that can prepare for Shabbat or Yom Tov, but food cannot be prepared for Yom Tom on Shabbat, even inside the hen. They asked Rabbah, "Shabbat and Yom Tov do not always occur on consecutive days, so the egg should be permitted then!" He answered that the Sages prohibited this in all situations because sometimes Shabbat and Yom Tov fall out on consecutive days.
