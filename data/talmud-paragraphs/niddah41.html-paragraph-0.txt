Niddah 41 - Caesarean of an Animal Earlier we saw that Rabbi Shimon gives to children born by caesarean all the laws of ritual purity of the regular birth. However, as explained Rabbi Yochanan, Rabbi Shimon gives this law only to people. An animal born by caesarean is not considered normal birth, and such animal cannot be consecrated as sacrifice. Why not? Rabbi Shimon compared this to a firstborn animal: just as a firstborn "opens the womb," so too a sacrificial animal should be born by "opening the womb." And why does Rabbi Shimon compare the two laws at all? - Because in the description of both the term "birth" was used.
