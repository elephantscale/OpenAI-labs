 Who is considered a boor? - Anyone who does not say the Shema in the evening and in the morning - this is the definition of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says, "Anyone who does not wear tefillin." Ben Azzai says, "Anyone who does not have tzitzit fringes on his four-cornered garment." Rabbi Nathan says, "Anyone who does not have a mezuzah on his home's entrance." Rabbi Nathan bar Yosef says, "Anyone who has children but does not raise them to study Torah." Others say, "Even if he learned the five books of the Torah and the clear rulings of the Mishna, he is a boor is he has not studied the Talmud" - and the accepted law is like these "others," which is a codename for Rabbi Meir.
