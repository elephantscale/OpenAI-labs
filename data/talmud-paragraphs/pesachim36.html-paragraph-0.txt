Pesachim 36 - Flour used for joyful occasions Every two out of three years, one separates the second tithe from his grain, then takes it to Jerusalem, to celebrate and to eat the tithe there. Furthermore, this tithe cannot be given to a bereaved, but rather it is reserved for joyful occasions. Can one make matzah out of it? - No, because matzah is called "the bread of affliction" - these are the words of Rabbi Yosi HaGlili. However, Rabbi Akiva disagrees: the Torah has mentioned the word "matzah" many times, to indicate that even the second tithe flour can be used. But matzah is called "bread of affliction!?" - fine, just don't make it with wine, oil, or honey. Still, "bread of affliction," "lechem oni" does hint at bereavement? - No, it does not, rather it means "bread of answer" - since over matzah we answer many questions.
