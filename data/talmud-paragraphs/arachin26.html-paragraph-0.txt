Arachin 26 - A Field That Was Not Redeemed If Jubilee year arrived and the field had not been redeemed, there are three diametrically opposed possible outcomes. One is described by Rabbi Yehudah: the Kohanim take possession of the field, but they must pay the full redemption price of fifty silver shekels per measure of barley to the treasury. Why? Because a consecrated field is similar to a consecrated house (the Torah uses the same word, "holy"), and the house is never redeemed without a payment.
