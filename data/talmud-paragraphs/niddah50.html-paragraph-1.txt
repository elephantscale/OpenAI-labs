 Everyone who is qualified to judge is qualified to testify, but there are some who are qualified to testify but not to judge. Who is they? - One who is blind in one eye - he cannot be a judge. However, this is only the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who derived it from the Torah's use of the word, "on the day" talking about the laws of money judgments and of spiritual leprosy: just as the leper must be examined with "the entire sight of the Kohen," so too the judge must have complete vision.
