Shabbat 58 - Servant's emblem Shmuel stated, "A servant may go out in the public place on Shabbat wearing his master's emblem - if it is tied around his neck, but not if it is sown into his clothing." Elsewhere, however, he said that a servant may not go out even when an emblem around his neck. However, these two contradictory rulings apply to different situations: in one case the the emblem was made for the servant by the master, and in another case he fashioned it by himself.
