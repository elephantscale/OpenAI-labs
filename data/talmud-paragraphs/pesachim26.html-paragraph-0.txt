Pesachim 26 - Incidental pleasures Consider a case where one is planning to do something permitted, but an additional forbidden pleasure comes his way in the course of it. For example, he plans to travel to a certain destination, but on his way, there is an idolatrous temple, from which there comes a fragrant smell of idolatrous spices. (Of course, we are not talking about a case where he intentionally inhales to enjoy the smell, but rather he is just passing by, and it fills his nostrils anyway). Should one avoid this nevertheless? Abaye says it is permitted, and he need not avoid it, but Rava says that it is prohibited, and one must avoid it.
