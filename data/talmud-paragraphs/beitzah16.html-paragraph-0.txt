Beitzah 16 - Fixed income A person's available income for the year is fixed and is decided on Rosh Hashanah. Therefore one should not make extravagant purchases - because his income for food won't be increased. However, he can freely spend more for Shabbat and Yom Tov's needs and the Torah education of his children - because the extra amounts will be added to his allotment. Shammai would always buy things in honor of Shabbat from the first day of the week, and if he saw something better - he would buy that too and eat the previous one on a weekday. On the other hand, Hillel was unconcerned, trusting that God would provide him with the needs for Shabbat when the day came.
