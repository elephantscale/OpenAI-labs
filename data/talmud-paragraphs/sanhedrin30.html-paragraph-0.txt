Sanhedrin 30 - Are Court Proceedings Public? Ordinarily, the verdict is handed down orally. However, the loosing litigant is entitled to a written record of the verdict. Rabbi Yochanan says that the verdict reads "He is not liable", and individual opinions of the judges are not recorded, because of "Do not be a gossipmonger..." Resh Lakish holds that the names of the judges are recorded with their opinions of "liable" or "not liable," because otherwise the verdict has the appearance of a lie. Rabbi Elazar finds a compromise: "Through their words so-and-so was found not liable" - which implies that the verdict was not unanimous.
