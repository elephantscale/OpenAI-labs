 An oath requires a definite measure. For example, if one says, "I delivered a house full of produce to you for safekeeping," or "a purse full of money," and the guardian says, "I do not know how much you gave, but I am giving you back everything," - he does not have to swear. However, if he says that the produce reached to the ceiling beam, and the guardian says that it only reached the window - the guardian has to swear due to his partial admission.
