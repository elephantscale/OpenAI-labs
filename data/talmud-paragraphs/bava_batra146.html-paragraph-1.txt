 "All the days of a pauper are bad" - this is the Talmudist, because he arduously toils, trying to understand the differences between different rulings. "But he of good heart has a continuous feast" - this is the Mishnaist, who just learns the rulings themselves - so says Rabbi Zeira. But Rava says the opposite - since the Mishnaist experiences greater frustration, not being able to rule on practical questions of law.
