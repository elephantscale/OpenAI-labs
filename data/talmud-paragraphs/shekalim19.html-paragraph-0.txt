Shekalim 19 - Found coins While putting money into the collection chests we discussed before, one could err and drop them on the floor. If such coins are later found near the chests, we need to know what to do with them - because they had been designated for a specific purpose. The rule is like this: if, for example, the coins were found next to the "Shekalim" chests, we assume that they are for shekalim. If they were found closer to the adjacent "voluntary offerings" chest, we assume that they are for that purpose. If they are exactly in the middle, we take the more stringent view and put them in the voluntary offerings. Thus "close to" is a ruling principle, but we take the most stringent possibility into account in cases of doubt.
