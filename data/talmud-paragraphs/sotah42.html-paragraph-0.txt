Sotah 42 - Kohen at war A Kohen is appointed and anointed to go to war with the army. When the army approaches the enemy, he talks to the soldiers and says the following words, speaking in Hebrew. How do we know that he is talking in Hebrew? Because of the term, "he will say (vediber)." The same word describes Moses, "and Moses said, and God replied with a voice." Since Moses spoke to God in Hebrew, the Kohen at war also spoke in Hebrew.
