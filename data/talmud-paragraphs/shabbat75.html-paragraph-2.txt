 Another one of the prohibited Shabbat labors is slaughtering an animal. What exact prohibited action is he performing? Rav said, "He is dyeing. When he makes the cut in the animal's throat, required for proper slaughter, the blood spurts out and colors the animal's neck. " Shmuel said, "He is taking a life." But according to Rav, isn't he also liable for taking a life? - Indeed, he is, and Rav meant, "Also for dyeing." Rav also said, "If I don't explain my view, the future generations will come to ridicule me. Why is the slaughterer interested in dyeing the throat of the animal with blood? - Because then the meat commands a higher price in the market."
