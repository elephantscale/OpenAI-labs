 Rav Yitzchak was sitting at a meal with Rav Nachman, and Rav Nachman asked him to say something, but Rav Yitchak replied, "One should not talk during a meal, so as not to choke." After the meal, he said, "Jacob never died." Rav Nachman jumped in surprise, "But they embalmed and buried him!" Rav Yitzhak replied, "I am just interpreting the phrase, 'I will redeem Israel and Jacob.' Just as Israel must be alive to be redeemed, so too Jacob."
