 No one may ride on the king's horse, no one may sit on his throne, and no one may use his scepter. No one may observe the king when he is getting a haircut (every day), when is undressed, or when he is in the bathhouse, following "You shall surely place upon yourself a king..." - the awe of the king must be upon you.
