 If the judges found it necessary to impose a time limit and told the litigant, after issuing a verdict against him, "All evidence that you may have to support your claim, you must produce within the next thirty days," then the rule is: if he finds evidence within thirty days, he can nullify the verdict, but if he finds it after thirty days, he cannot nullify the verdict.
