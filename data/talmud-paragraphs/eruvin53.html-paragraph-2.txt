 The Talmud then finds multiple examples where using precise language is very important, and ends up with the story of Rabbi Yehoshua, who asked a boy sitting at a crossroad, "Which is a good road to town?" The boy said that one road was short but long, and the other - long but short. Rabbi Yehoshua chose the short road, but near the town he was met with gardens and fences, which made it very hard to pass. He came back and asked the boy about his advice. The boy said, "Didn't I tell you, it was short but long?" Rabbi Yehoshua then chose the long but short road and eventually got there.
