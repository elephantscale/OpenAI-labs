 Then why is it prohibited to wear an emblem sown into clothing? According to our explanation, it should be allowed, at least when it is made by the master? For that we have another reason: commonly these emblems were made of clay, and they could break and fall of the garment. Should that happen, the servant might be afraid lest his master see it and be angry; so the servant would take the cloak off and fold it, hiding the place of the emblem. Then he would be liable for carrying his cloak. Therefore, the Sages prohibited him from wearing such cloak on Shabbat in a public area.
