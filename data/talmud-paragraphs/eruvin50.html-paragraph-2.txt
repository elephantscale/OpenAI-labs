 What does it mean, "He has not said anything?" Rav says, literally, he got nothing: he lost his current area, did not acquire a new one, and has to stay within four steps of the place where the sundown catches him. However, Shmuel says that he acquired his residence somewhere, only it is not known where. Therefore, he can walk to the tree, if it is close enough, but he may not walk to his home - if it is exactly two thousand steps from the tree. That is because his residential four steps may be behind the trunk, away from home, and thus farther away than two thousand steps from his home.
