Rosh Hashanah 3 - What is special about the month of Nisan? The New Year of the Jewish kings is counted from the same month as the Exodus. Why? Because of the phrase "In the four hundred and eightieth year from Exodus... in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, he built the Temple." There is a comparison between Exodus and the years of a Jewish king, so they start counting from the same month.
