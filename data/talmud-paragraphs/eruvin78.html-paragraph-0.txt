Eruvin 78 - Ditch If two courtyards are separated by a ditch that is at least ten hand-breadths deep and four hand-breadths wide, then - since it is not convenient to step over such ditch - it separates the two courtyards into two, and they need to make a separate eruv (common food). This eruv will allow the residents of each courtyard to carry in it, but not into the other courtyard. Even if they fill the ditch with stubble or straw, it still separates them, because those materials will not remain there but will likely be removed. If, however, they fill the ditch with earth or pebbles, then - since those materials will likely stay n there - the ditch has been effectively closed, and they can make only one eruv for all of them.
