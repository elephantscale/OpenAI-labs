Menachot 101 - Which Offerings May be Redeemed If an animal offering became blemished, it may be redeemed, that is, exchanged for money. After redemption, the money becomes sanctified and has to be used for the same purpose as the animal was designated for, and the animal can be used. The law about the redemption of animals is stated in the Torah, but what other offerings can be similarly redeemed?
