 Can we resolve our question from our previous ruling? There the husband could still revoke the vow, so it must be that divorce is tantamount to silence and expresses no opinion! - No, perhaps our ruling only discusses the case where the husband did not hear her vow. The ruling just gives us the fundamental law that if the father heard about the vow and the groom did not, they only have one day to veto it. About our question, the ruling may be offering no opinion whatsoever.
