 Sometimes, when an animal was in difficult labor, they would cut off a piece of the fetus, to ease the pain of the animal. Since there is a necessity for this measure, it is not prohibited as cruelty to animals. If he leaves the limb inside the womb and later slaughters the mother, this limb (and the whole fetus) is permitted to be eaten. The Torah said, "Any that has a split hoof and chews its cud - among the animals..." "Among the animals" (ba behemah) can be understood as "within an animal" - and this serves as the source for the law about a fetus.
