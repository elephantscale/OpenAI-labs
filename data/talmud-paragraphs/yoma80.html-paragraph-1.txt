 Since the Torah said, "Any food that is eaten," we understand that we are talking about food coming from another food. And what is it? - Chicken egg: it is food, and it comes from another food, a chicken. But maybe it is a young goat, which comes from its mother, who is also food? - No, it does not just "come," but it requires slaughter. But perhaps it is an egg of a bar-yuchani bird, which is as big as sixty cities? - No, because we have a rule: one, who tries to grab a little, succeeds in that, and may even be added more, but one who tries to grab a lot - he may not be given anything at all, and so we have to limit ourselves to a chicken egg. But perhaps the Torah meant an egg of a tiny bird?
