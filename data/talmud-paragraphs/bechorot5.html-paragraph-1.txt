 Rabbi Yochanan, "But the firstborn brought sacrifices in the desert, before the Tabernacle was built!?" Resh Lakish: "These were firstborn born in Egypt, but not born in the desert. In fact, I have a question against you from your proof: the Tabernacle was built one year after the Exodus, so how could one-year-old firstborn bring sacrifices?" Now, that is so obvious, how could Rabbi Yochanan ask such a question? He answers, "If there was no firstborn sanctification in the desert, the previous one also ceased."
