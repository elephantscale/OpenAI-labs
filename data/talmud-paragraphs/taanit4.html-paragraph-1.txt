 Three have asked God incorrectly, but in two cases, that got a proper reply. The first one was Eliezer, who prayed, "The girl that comes out first will be Isaac's wife." This could include someone with a bodily defect or unfit, but he was answered by Rebecca coming to the well. The second one was Saul, who promised to "make rich and marry his daughter" to a person who would fight Goliath. This could have been a slave or a mamzer, marriage with whom would be forbidden. But he was answered with David stepping up to the task.
