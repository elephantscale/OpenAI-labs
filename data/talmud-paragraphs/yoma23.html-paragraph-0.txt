Yoma 23 - David and Shaul On the previous page, we mentioned that one should not count the Jews. Two people who did count were King Shaul and King David, and Talmud continues with them. King Shaul was without a blemish, and that exactly was his blemish. One needs to have a "basket of creepy-crawlies" behind his back so that if he becomes haughty, they can tell him, "Looks where you come from!" So even though Shaul did fewer wrong acts, David, when he erred, cried and asked for forgiveness, which counts more.
