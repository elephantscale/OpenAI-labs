 Whether a pagan doctor may circumcise an Israelite is the subject of a disagreement. Rabbi Meir forbids it, because of suspicion of murder or mutilation. Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai allows it, because of "you will surely circumcise" but does not approve of it. Rabbi Yehudah the Prince forbids it and allows only one who is obligated in circumcision to circumcise others, based on "and you (Abraham), keep the covenant."
