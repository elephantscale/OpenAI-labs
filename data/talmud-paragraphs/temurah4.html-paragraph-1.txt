 Another rule is that if a prohibition can be remedied, then one does not receive lashes for it. But, is that always true? For example, sacrifice exchange has a remedy - treating the new sacrifice with the laws of sacrificial holiness, and one still gets lashes!? - Exchange is prohibited twice, "don't exchange and don't substitute", so it is especially severe.
