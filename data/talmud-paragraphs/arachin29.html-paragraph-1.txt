 If one pronounced a dedication but did not specify who it should go to, then it goes to the upkeep of the Temple - so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira, since the Torah said, "Any dedication ("cherem") is most holy to God." However, the Sages says that any unspecified dedication goes to the Kohanim, since the Torah said, "Any dedicated field shall be to the Kohen." If so, how do the Sages explain the phrase used by Rabbi Yehoshua? - It teaches that one can dedicate ("cherem") even offerings that are already holy , which will result in additional obligations on his part.
