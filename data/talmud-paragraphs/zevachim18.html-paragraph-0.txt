Zevachim 18 - A Priest Who is Under-dressed or Overdressed Any Kohen priest who lacks the required four priestly garments, invalidates the sacrificial service. The four garments are pants, tunic, belt, and hat. Since the Torah said that "You shall girdle them with sash and put turbans on them and the priesthood will be for them an eternal law", we see that when they have all the garments, they are considered priests, but if they lack some, they are considered strangers, and a stranger invalidates the service.
