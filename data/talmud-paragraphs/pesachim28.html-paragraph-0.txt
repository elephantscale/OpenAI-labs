Pesachim 28 - Some say, chametz is allowed Rabbi Yehudah says that the only way to destroy chametz is by burning it in a fire. The Sages disagree and say to him, "You sound stringent here, but this will lead to a great leniency later on: if one does not have firewood, what is he to do?" Rabbi Yehudah tries to prove his point of view to the Sages by comparing chametz to various offerings that must be burned. Still, he is ultimately disproved by contradictions with his earlier statements. The Talmud then applies to him a proverb, "The arrow maker was killed by his own arrow."
