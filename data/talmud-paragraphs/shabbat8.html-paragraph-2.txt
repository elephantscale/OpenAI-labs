 If the basket overturned in the air and landed on its rim, then even if it was seven hand-breadths, one is not liable: while in the air, being three hand-breadths above the ground, it had its walls downwards, and using the principle that "one may extend the walls" we say that it already touched the ground while it was in the air above ten hand-breadths, and as we just saw, one is not liable for partial transfers.
