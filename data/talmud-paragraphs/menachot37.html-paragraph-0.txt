Menachot 37 - The Tefillin of a Lefty The arm tefillin must be worn on the weaker arm, since the commandment is to "bind it on your arm" (yadchah), which may be read as "yad kah"- the weaker arm. There are many opinions as to how an amputee wears his tefillin. Tosafot say that one who is completely missing his left arm does not wear the tefillin at all, one who is missing the lower portion of his left arm dons tefillin on his stump, and one who is missing the lower portion of the right arm is considered a lefty and dons tefillin on his right stump.
