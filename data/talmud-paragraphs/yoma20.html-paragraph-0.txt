Yoma 20 - Chasing away sleep If during the night of Yom Kippur, the High Priest started to doze off, the young priests would snap fingers loudly in front of him and say, "Our Master High Priest, please stand up and do an exercise on the floor," and thus they kept him awake all night. Prominent people of Jerusalem would not sleep and would make their voices heard to support the High Priest.
