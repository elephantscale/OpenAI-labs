Sanhedrin 96 - Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan, and the Temple When king Chizkiah was ill and then recovered, the sun reversed its course. The king of Assyria sent him a letter, "Greeting to Chizkiah, greetings to Jerusalem, greetings to the great God!" Nebuchadnezzar was the king's secretary, and he ran after the messenger in order to rewrite this letter in the correct order of greetings. He made three steps and was rewarded with the opportunity to destroy Jerusalem. People now make three steps at the end of prayer, asking to restore Jerusalem.
