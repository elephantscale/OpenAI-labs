Keritot 27 - One Cannot Re-Use A Sin-Offering If one designated an animal as his sin-offering and then died, his son cannot bring it, even if his son committed exactly the same sin. One may not even bring his sin-offering, which designated to atone for one transgression, for his other, and even if it is exactly the same. Thus, if one designated a sin-offering for forbidden fat he ate last evening, he cannot bring it to another for the forbidden fat he ate today. Why is all this? Because the Torah said, "he shall bring his offering for his transgression," and two extra words "his" exclude any re-use of a sin-offering.
