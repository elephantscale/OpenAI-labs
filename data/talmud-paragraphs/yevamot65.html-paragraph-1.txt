 If she was then married the fourth time and had children, can she claim the Ketubah from the third husband? - Here, we apply the rule, "Your silence is better than your speech." He can counterclaim and say, "Had I known that you were fertile, I would never divorce you. So it was not a divorce, and you are still married to me, and your new children are mamzerim." However, the court can say, "Even if she is silent if that is the truth, then we must act!" Instead, the correct claim is that it is only now that she became healthy and fertile, but at the time of divorce, she was unable to conceive, and therefore the third husband is not liable to pay.
