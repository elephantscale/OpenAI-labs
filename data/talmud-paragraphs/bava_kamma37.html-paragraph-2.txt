 If an ox is warned regarding its own species but not other species, or regarding young animals but not mature animals, the owner pays full damages where warned but half damages where not warned. Students asked Rabbi Yehudah about an ox warned for goring on Sabbath. He said, "for goring on Sabbath he pays full damages, on weekdays, half-damages."
