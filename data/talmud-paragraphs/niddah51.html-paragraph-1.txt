 Every seven year in Israel there is Shmita - no plowing or harvesting (there are different opinions as to whether it applies nowadays). One can collect fruit and vegetables for his own use though, but when there is no more of that species available in the fields, he has to take his supply into the street also, and declare it ownerless, free for all to take. Any species that one is obligated to make ownerless (this is called "removal"), he is also obligated to observe other Shmita laws with, such as not using it for commerce and treating them in a special way. However, mint root, for instance, is always available, because it is underground, so although there are Shmita laws for it, there is no "removal" requirement.
