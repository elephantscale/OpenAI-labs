Brachot 46 - The host breaks bread, and the guest blesses Rabbi Zeira once took ill, and Rabbi Abahu, who came to visit him, took upon himself a vow, "If this small man with singed thighs recovers, I will make a big meal for the Sages." At the meal, Rabbi Abahu invited Rabbi Zeira to say the blessing and break the bread, but Rabbi Zeira refused, quoting the rule that "The host breaks bread." When after the meal Rabbi Abahu asked Rabbi Zeira to saying the prayer after the meal, he again refused, saying that the one who broke bread should also say the prayer after it. However, the last rule is not like that. Rather, the host breaks bread, because he will give big pieces with a good gesture, and the guest says the prayer after the meal, in which he includes a blessing for the host.
