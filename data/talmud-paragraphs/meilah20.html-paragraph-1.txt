 If an agent misappropriated the property of the Temple, by following precisely the instruction given him by another, the one who gave the instruction is responsible for misappropriation, but the agent is not. However, if the agent deviates from the instruction, he becomes liable. For example, if one told his agent, "Give my guests meat," and the agent gave them liver, (and later it was discovered that it was Temple property) the agent has committed misappropriation.
