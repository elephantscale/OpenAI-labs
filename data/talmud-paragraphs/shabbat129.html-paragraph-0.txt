Shabbat 129 - A woman who gave birth On a holiday or on Shabbat one should not deliver an animal of its young, by taking hold of a fetus in the womb and pulling it out. Some say that this requires excessive exertion, while others - that it represents the final step in birth, and making a final step in creating anything is forbidden Shabbat. However, one is allowed to help the animal to give birth, by grasping the young when it emerges, so that it does not fall to the ground. One may also blow into its nostrils to clear them of mucus and put a teat into its mouth so it would suckle.
