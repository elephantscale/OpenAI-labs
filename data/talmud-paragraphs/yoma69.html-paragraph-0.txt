Yoma 69 - Can one remove the desire to do evil? While waiting for the goat to arrive in the desert, the High Priest sits in the part of the Temple called "Women's Courtyard," where one is permitted to sit. They bring him the Torah. He stands up, receives it, and reads passages about Yom Kippur. If he wants to do this in the linen white garments in which he was performing the service, he is allowed to, or else he can use his own garments.
