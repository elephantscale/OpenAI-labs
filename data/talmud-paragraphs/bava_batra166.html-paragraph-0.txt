Bava Batra 166 - Contradictory Amounts in Loan Documents If a loan document restates the amount in different units, and these don't agree, such as "so-and-so borrowed 100 zuz, which is 20 sela" - whereas in truth 20 sela constitutes only 80 zuz - the lender can collect only the lesser of the two amounts, 20 sela in our example, following the rule that "to extract money from his fellow, the burden of proof lies with the claimant."
