Shabbat 27 - A small piece of clothing A small piece of clothing the size of three by three finger-breadths is somewhat useful as a garment, because poor people can use it for patches. It does not have complete utility though, since rich people don't have any use for such small clothing. Nevertheless, the Torah gives it the status of a garment, and it is subject to the spiritual disease of tzaraat (white spots looking like leprosy), which indicates to the owner that he has some defects: stinginess, bad talk, etc.. How do we know that this indeed is the minimal size?
