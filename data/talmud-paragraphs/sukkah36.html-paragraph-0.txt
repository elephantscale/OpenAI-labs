Sukkah 36 - Etrog must be beautiful Etrog must be gorgeous since Torah called it the "fruit of a glorious tree." Thus, for example, if it was split or punctured to miss a slight piece, it is invalid. However, if it was punctured with a needle but is complete, it still looks good, and therefore it is valid.
