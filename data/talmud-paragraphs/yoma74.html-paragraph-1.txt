 What is the basis for this disagreement? Rabbi Yochanan says that since small amounts do add to the amount which is prohibited by the Torah, it must be that these small amounts are themselves prohibited, for otherwise, where does the prohibition come from? However, Resh Lakish says that eating a small amount is not called "eating," Thus, it is simply not included in the prohibition.
