 A kohen whose relative, one of the seven close ones - father, mother, brother, unmarried sister, son, daughter, or spouse - has died this day. Since Aharon was specifically requested to continue the service after his two sons died, "And he need not leave the Sanctuary and he will not profane...", we understand that all other Kohanim would profane the service.
