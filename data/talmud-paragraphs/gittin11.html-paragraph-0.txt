Gittin 11 - Is it good to be divorced? A man does not have to personally deliver the divorce (Get) to his wife; he can appoint a messenger. If, while messenger is on his way, the husband changes his mind, the Get becomes invalid, and the divorce does not happen. Thus, the husband can change his mind while the messenger is en route.
