 The standard material used for making shoes is leather. When talking about not wearing shoes on Yom Kippur, do we mean only leather shoes or perhaps any kind of shoes? Again, an actual story helps: Rav Yitzchak saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi wearing shoes made out of rush (reed) on Yom Kippur. And yet, some say that all kinds of shoes were meant.
