 There was an incident with a certain woman who came before Rabbi Akiva and said, "I found a stain." He asked her, "Perhaps you had a wound?" She replied, "Yes, but it healed." He then said, "Perhaps if you moisten it, it will bring forth blood?" She answered, "Yes," in he declared her ritually pure. He saw that his students were looking at each other and told them, "Why is this difficult in your eyes? The Sages who enacted the laws of stains did it with the provision to be treated leniently."
