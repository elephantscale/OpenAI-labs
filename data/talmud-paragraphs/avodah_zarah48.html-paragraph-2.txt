 Similar laws apply to stones and trees that were worshipped. However, a tree under which there is an idol is a subject of disagreement between Rabbi Shimon and the Sages. The Sages forbid it, but Rabbi Shimon allows it if the worship can be attributed to the idol underneath. It once happened in Sidon that Rabbi Shimon told to his followers to examine the heap under a worshiped tree. They found an image there, and he permitted the tree.
