Makkot 11 - Unintentional Killer and the High Priest An unintentional killer who is exiled to a city of refuge can leave the city and go home upon the High Priest's death. This includes any High Priest: one who was anointed with oil or by wearing special garments, and even one who served temporarily. Rabbi Yehudah says, "Even the High Priest anointed for war." Therefore the mothers of High Priests would supply the exiles with food and clothing, so that they would not pray for their sons to die.
