 If one leased a field from his fellow, and it had a stream from which it could be conveniently watered, or a tree which produced fruit without requiring much work - the field thus commanding a higher rent - and the spring dried up or the tree was felled, he may not deduct anything from his rent in compensation for his loss. If he mentioned that his reason for renting the fields was the river or the tree - then he may deduct.
