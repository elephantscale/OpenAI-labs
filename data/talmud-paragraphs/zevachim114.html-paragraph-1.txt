 The reason of the Sages is clear - a temporarily blemished animal cannot be currently brought "before God," but what is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? - He bases his opinion on the phrase, "You shall not do everything we do today, each man what is proper in his eyes." The word "proper" means "proper in the eyes of the man who offers" now, and will become so in the eyes of God later - and it is this action that "you shall not do."
