Horayot 9 - Who Brings What Sacrifice For any commandment in the Torah, for the violation of which one is liable to excision if done on purpose, and to a sin-offering, if done by mistake, the actual sacrifice is different. An individual brings a she-lamb or a she-goat as his sin-offering, also called an "offering for a mistake." The leader of the nation brings a he-goat, the anointed High Priest and the court bring a bull.
