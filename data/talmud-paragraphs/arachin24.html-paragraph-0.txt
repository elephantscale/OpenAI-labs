Arachin 24 - Redemptions from the Temple How does one collect debts from the Temple property? For example, if someone consecrated his possessions to the Temple, but part of them were needed to pay the Ketubah of his wife or his debt obligation - the one who redeems the complete amount refunds a part as a Ketubah or debt payment. The payments do not go directly from the Temple to individuals, so that people would not think that sacred property can be converted to private property without redemption.
