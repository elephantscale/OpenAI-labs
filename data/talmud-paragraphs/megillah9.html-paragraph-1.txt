 In other places, however, there are different, seemingly contradicting rules. The Talmud distills this as follows: tefillin and mezuzah need to be written in Hebrew, because in their text there is a phrase "these words will be for you," - that is, they will be as they are in the Torah, without change. Megillah, too, has an instruction, "according to their script and according to their language," that is, it should not be changed.
