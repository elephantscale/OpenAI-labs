Ketubot 91 - Two groups of children from two wives want the inheritance When people were allowed to have more than one wife, fathers were reluctant to give large dowries to their daughters. They were apprehensive that when their daughter and her husband died, the inheritance would go to the children of the other wife. Therefore, the Sages established a rule that when the children claim the inheritance, they can ask for their late mother's Ketubah first. Then they would divide the remaining estate equally with the other wives' children. This is called "Ketubah of the (male) children."
