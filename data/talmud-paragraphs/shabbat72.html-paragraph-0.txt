Shabbat 72 - Guilt A woman slave may be designated for another male slave, and in that case she is prohibited to other men. However, the punishments for cohabiting with her is different from the standard one of a regular married woman, and consists of bringing a guilt offering. Moreover, for multiple acts of cohabitation he is still liable for only one offering. This stands in contrast to Shabbat violation, where one brings an offering for each violation.
