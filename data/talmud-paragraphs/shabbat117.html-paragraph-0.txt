Shabbat 117 - Saving food As we learned before, one is allowed to save Torah scrolls from fire on Shabbat by carrying them outside the house, and this includes the tefillin. Moreover, if the tefillin bag has money in it, then - even though normally money cannot be handled on Shabbat - here he is not required to throw it away, but can save the bag with the tefillin and the money inside.
