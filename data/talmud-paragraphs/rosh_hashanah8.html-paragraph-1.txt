 There are two opinions: first of Elul, and thirty days later, first of Tishrei. Both are based on a phrase from the psalms, "The meadows (really, the ewes) are covered with flocks (really, by rams); the valleys are covered with corn, they shout and sing." The first teacher asks, "When do sheep become pregnant? - When valleys are covered with corn. And when is that? - In Adar. It turns out that the sheep give birth in Av, and their New Year is in Elul." The second teacher gives a different answer: "When do sheep become pregnant? When the stalks of corn sing with a rustling sound. This is a month later, in Nisan, and therefore sheep give birth a month later, in Elul, and their New Year is in Tishrei." However, the Talmud finds difficulty with this reading and goes on to the second explanation.
