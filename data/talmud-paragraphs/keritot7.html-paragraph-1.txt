 If one anoints Jewish kings or High Priest with anointing oil, and if these people were already anointed, so new oil is not needed for them, then Rabbi Meir holds him liable, while Rabbi Yehudah exempts him. The argue about the status of a person who initially was authorized (needed the oil) but is now unauthorized (does not need the oil) - is such a person considered a "stranger." We find that they disagree about this principle in other areas, such as the status of daughter of a Kohen who married to an regular Jew - does she have the rights and responsibilities of the daughter of a Kohen or not.
