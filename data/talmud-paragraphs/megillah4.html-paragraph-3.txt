 Why is the Megillah never read on Shabbat? All are obligated to hear it, but not all are experts in reading. Thus, one can take the scroll to the Sage on Shabbat to learn with him and, as a result, carry it in the public area, which is forbidden on Shabbat. It is also for the benefit of the poor people, who expect food and presents on Purim, and it would be harder to do this on Shabbat.
