 A similar case is where two witnesses said, "This man borrowed money and needs to repay it within thirty days," whereas in reality the loan term was ten years. If they are found to be false witnesses, they pay the amount that a person is willing to pay for having the loan in his possession for the extra time, and this is not prohibited interest.
