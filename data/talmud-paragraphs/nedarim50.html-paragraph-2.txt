 Rachel convinced Akiva to study at an academy, so he left the house and studied for twelve years. As he was coming back, he heard Rachel's neighbor saying to Rachel, "Your husband is not your equal, and moreover, he left you for twelve years - your father did right to disinherit you!" Rachel answered her, "If he listened, I would want him to study another twelve years." On hearing this, now a Rabbi, Akiva went back for another twelve years. He came back as the leading scholar of the generation.
