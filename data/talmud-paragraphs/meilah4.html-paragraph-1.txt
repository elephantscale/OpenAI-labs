 Strict offering, once consecrated, belongs completely to God, and one should not use it. If one does, he commits misappropriation. After it is slaughtered and its blood is thrown on the Altar, the Kohanim eat portions of it, and misappropriation does not apply. By contrast, lighter holy offering belong to God and man, and there is no problem of misappropriation for it. Once it is slaughtered and its blood is thrown, some of its parts go on the Altar, and there is misappropriation for them.
