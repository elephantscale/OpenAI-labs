Zevachim 96 - Chip the glasses and crack the plates! Any vessel in which meat of the sacrifices was cooked requires purging - if the utensil is made of metal, and breaking, if it is made of earthenware. This is true regardless whether the meat was cooked directly in this pot, or if the broth was poured into it from another pot taken off the flame. Even though the Torah gives this requirement when talking about most holy offerings, such as a sin-offering, it is nevertheless true in regards to regular holy offerings, such as a peace-offering. Rabbi Shimon disagrees and says that regular holy offerings do not require purging or breaking of the pots.
