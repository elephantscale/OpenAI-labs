 If one who touches a Torah scroll with his hands, they becomes ritually impure. That seems counter-intuitive, but the reason is that people used to store the Torah scrolls and ritually pure foods together, thinking they both are holy. However, mice would find the food and would also eat the scroll. With this decree, people would not store them together any longer.
