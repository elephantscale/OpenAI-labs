Taanit 31 - How to celebrate Tu B'Av The day of Tu B'Av was celebrated as follows: the maidens of Jerusalem would go in the orchards to dance and find their future husbands. Every girl wore a dress that she would borrow from someone else. The daughter of the King - from the daughter of the High Priest. She, in turn, borrowed from the daughter of the vice-priest. All others borrowed from each other - not to embarrass ones who did not have a beautiful dress. Lovely girls said that "A wife is only for beauty." Those of great lineage claimed that "the wife is only for children." The good-charactered said: "A good woman, who can find her? Give her the fruits of her hands and let her deeds praise her." Each group proved their point of view with phrases from the Scriptures. Those who lacked exceptional merit would point out that it all depends on marrying with altruistic intentions. They also added that jewelry and attractive clothing will compensate for the lack of natural beauty. Art: A girl in a picture frame by Rembrandt
