Sanhedrin 21 - Laws of the King "He shall not multiply wives..." - only up to eighteen - "... so that his heart is not turned away." Rabbi Yehudah says, "He may multiply wives beyond eighteen, provided that they do not turn his heart away from God." Rabbi Shimon says, "Even if one can turn his heart away, he may not marry her."
