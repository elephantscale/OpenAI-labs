 Did the chamber in which the High Priest lived for seven days before Yom Kippur have a mezuzah? Some say that a mezuzah was required there only for those seven days, but they still kept it throughout the year, lest they forget to put it on, or lest the people say that the High Priest is locked in a prison. Others say even those seven days are a disagreement: even though the High Priest did not choose to live there but was forced to, it is still considered a valid dwelling that needs a mezuzah - so say the Sages. In contrast, Rabbi Yehudah says that it was not considered a proper dwelling, and the mezuzah was not required. All agree, though, that practically it still was there.
