Sanhedrin 38 - Know What to Answer a Heretic Said Rabbi Eliezer: "Be diligent in the study of Torah and know what to answer a heretic," so that you can answer the challenges that are based on Scripture. Said Rabbi Yochanan, "That is only with regard to a pagan heretic, but as for a Jewish heretic, do not debate him, for he will become even more heretical."
