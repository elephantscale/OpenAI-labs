 In case he appoints a messenger, and this messenger comes from overseas, there is an additional requirement for him. He has to verify that he saw the Get written by the scribe and signed by the witnesses. Why this requirement? - People outside of Israel were not experts in divorce laws and might have missed a critical condition: that the Get is written for the specific woman the husband wants to divorce. It cannot, therefore, be written in advance, nor can a printed form be used. So if the scribe or the witnesses miss this, the Get would be invalid, even though the document would look OK, and this could create a problem later on. This is the opinion of Rabbah.
