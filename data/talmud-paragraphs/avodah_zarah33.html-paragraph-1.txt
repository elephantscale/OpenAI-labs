 A non-Jewish idol-worshipper will certainly reach his destination and praise his deity for any successful trade. However, when he is coming back, his attitude is that what was - was, and he is not going back to give thanks to his idol again. In contrast, we assume that a Jew going to worship idols will change his mind. However, once there, and idol-worship being a new and fresh experience for him, he gets attached to the idol more than a non-Jew, and certainly will go back to praise the idol for any good deal he finds.
