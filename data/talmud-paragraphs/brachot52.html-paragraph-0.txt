Brachot 52 - Laws of the meal, Beit Shammai vs Beit Hillel Some of the disagreements between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel concern specifically the order of meals. For example, when one recites Kiddush (Sanctification) welcoming Shabbat and the Shabbat meal, then Beit Shammai says that he should first mention the day (Shabbat) and then the wine, and Beit Hillel reverse the order. Why? Beit Shammai defend their order: the day (Shabbat) causes the wine and the meal, and besides, Shabbat is already here, and the wine is only now brought to the table. However, Beit Hillel argue that the wine causes the sanctification, since if there is no wine, the Kiddush is not said. Moreover, wine is more common than Shabbat, and the rule is that things that are more common take precedence.
