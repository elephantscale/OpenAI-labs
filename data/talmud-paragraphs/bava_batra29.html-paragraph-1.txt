 Why three years? For three years after purchasing a property, a person is careful with his deed, but longer than that he is not careful to keep his deed unless his occupancy of the property has been challenged. Therefore, after three years of the unchallenged use of a property, we do not insist that the occupant produce documentary proof of his ownership; rather, we rely on his very occupancy as proof.
