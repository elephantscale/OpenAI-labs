 Rav Avin said that if he tears to cool his anger, then he has achieved a constructive purpose and should be liable for it on Shabbat. But is such behavior even allowed? One should never get angry, and freely venting one's anger is tantamount to subjugating oneself to its power, where one's soul burns out!? - True! What Rav Avin meant is that one only pretends to be angry, to show his displeasure with specific people.
