 On the subject of "trembling of the limbs," Shmuel said: "Any semen that is emitted without being felt throughout one's body does not convey ritual impurity." Another version of what Shmuel said, "Any seed that does not shoot forth like an arrow cannot fertilize." According to the second version, semen that exits without a feeling cannot fertilize but still produces impurity.
