 Or, if you want, I can give you another explanation. Since the laws of the sukkah are numerous (shade, sun, walls, etc.) it is easier to just say "invalid" and let you find a way to fix it. The laws of an alley are relatively simpler, and the Sages can start teaching them right away by saying "place it lower."
