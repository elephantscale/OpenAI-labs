 We mentioned that the people who lived in villages can read the Megillah earlier, such as if they come to a city on the day of court assembly, Monday or Thursday. Who does this enactment benefit? Mainly, the people in the cities, because their brethren living in villages supply them with food and will be available for this on the day of Purim; but also partially benefits the villagers, for they won't have to make a second trip, having visited the city before.
