 If however, he limits his abstinence vow for a week or two, then we need to estimate when this situation becomes unbearable, and he has to give a divorce after that. How long is that? Beit Shammai says that it is two weeks. What is their logic? - In the Torah, there is a situation where they have to be apart for two weeks, that is, after the birth of a daughter, but more than this is too much. Beit Shammai compares the situation caused by the husband (vow) to the birth, also caused by the husband. However, Beit Hillel argues that "too long" is one week. They compare this to niddah, which lasts for one week and make an analogy between common occurrences - niddah and vows.
