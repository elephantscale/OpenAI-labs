 Nachum HaMede made this mistake: he annulled all nazir vows for people who made them close to the Temple destruction. The Sages corrected him: if they vowed before the destruction, their vows were, in fact, valid. But they knew the Second Temple would be destroyed 490 (seventy weeks ) years after the first one, so how could they vow in earnest?! - They still hoped their period of being a nazir would finish while the Temple stood.
