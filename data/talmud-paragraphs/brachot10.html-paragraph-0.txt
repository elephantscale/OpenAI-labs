Brachot 10 - Prayer of the Refined One must say the Shema prayer in the morning, "when people rise." When is that? When there is enough light to distinguish between the blue and the white wool (which is used in one's tzitzit). Some say, he needs to distinguish between a wolf and a dog, and some - to recognize his friend from four steps away. When does the time to say the Shema end? Rabbi Eliezer says, at sunrise, since most people are up by then, but Rabbi Yehoshua says, "Three hours into the day, since kings do sleep that late."
