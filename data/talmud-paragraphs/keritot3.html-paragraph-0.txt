Keritot 3 - Can One Transgress All Thirty-Six Prohibitions? We have said that one who transgresses all thirty-six prohibitions in one period of forgetfulness has to bring a sacrifice for each one. But why not bring one "mistake offering" for all? Rabbi Yochanan explained, "Just as the Torah singled out relations with one sister - which it already prohibited - for a separate violation, so too all other violations are separate." However, others learn the rule of separate sacrifices from an extra word "woman" in the phrase "woman who did not go to a mikva." How do they use the prohibition of a sister? - To teach that one who has relations with his sister who is also his father's and his mother's sister, brings three sacrifices.
