Eruvin 34 - Eruv too low or too high If one placed his eruv food at the bottom of a pit, even hundreds feet deep, he eruv is still accessible to him and is therefore valid. Why do we need to be told this, it is obvious?! If the pit is in the private area - why, the pit is also a private area, and it goes all the way down and all they way up; thus, to get his eruv he does not need to transfer from a private to a public domain, and there is no prohibition in that. Rather, it must be that the pit is in the public area. But then he would not be allowed to get the food out, and the eruv would not be valid. Rather, it must be that the pit is in an area that is neither public nor private, and such transfers are prohibited only by the decree of the Sagse - which does not apply on Friday with the twilight, when the eruv takes effect! Thus, he can get his food at this time, and the eruv is valid.
