 The lower sign (two pubic hairs) always comes before the upper sign (breast development). When the lower sign is present, the girl can do either halitzah or yibum, and when the upper sign (small fig stage of development) is present, we can presume the same - these are the words of the Sages. However, Rabbi Meir disagrees on two counts. If the upper sign is present, according to Rabbi Meir it means nothing, so she cannot halitzah, which only adults can do. And although minor can do yibum, Rabbi Meir does not allow it for a different reason: a minority of people never mature, and Rabbi Meir, who always takes a statistical minority into account, is apprehensive that the girl or a boy will never mature, and their yibum would retroactively violate a serious prohibition, so according to Rabbi Meir they must wait till they fully mature.
