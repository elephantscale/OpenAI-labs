 One who has extra digits in his hands and feet, that is, six on each - Rabbi Yehudah declares him fit, but the Sages say that he is unfit. They argue about a phrase in Samuel, "There was another war, and there was a man of huge stature, with six fingers on his hands and feet." The Sages consider these words a shame, but Rabbi Yehudah considers them a praise.
