 The wool on the heads of lambs and the hair on the beards of goats, as well as bones, sinews, horns, and hooves all have a special law: as long as they are attached to the burnt-offering they came with, they should be brought up on the Altar together with the offering, but if they are separate from it, they should not be brought.
