Chullin 34 - People Who Eat The Food as of it Were a Sacrifice Previously we quoted the rule that "if one slaughtered a domesticated animal, a wild kosher animal, or a bird, and blood did not come out of them, ... their meat may be eaten with unwashed hands." We also said that this rule cannot be talking about sacrifices, because wild animals were never brought as sacrifices in the Temple. Rather it was talking about the meat bought with the money of the second tithe.
