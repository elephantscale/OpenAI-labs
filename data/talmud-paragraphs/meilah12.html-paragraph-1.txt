 Bird sacrifices, turtledoves and pigeons, had to be of specific age: turtledoves - older than a year, and pigeons - younger than a year. Therefore, if turtledoves were too young, or pigeons were too old for the sacrifice, there was no prohibition of misappropriation for them. There Sages established a prohibition not to use them, but there are no Torah-imposed penalties if one does.
