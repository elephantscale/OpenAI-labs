 Another difference: the meat of the firstborn and tithe animals cannot be sold in a market, nor weighed out with weights, since this is degrading, and the owner has to take a loss on that. On the other hand, the meat of regular sacrifices that became blemished and were redeemed, can be sold in the market and weighed out in the regular way. This will fetch them a higher price, which is desired, because that money will be used to buy the next sacrifice.
