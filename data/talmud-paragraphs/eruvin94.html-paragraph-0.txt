Eruvin 94 - Broken wall If one of the walls of a courtyard completely collapsed, then this courtyard becomes a public area, and one who carries an object on Shabbat from a house to the courtyard has violated Shabbat and needs to bring an offering for his mistake - that is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Sages, however, say that the courtyard is not really public - people still do not walk there freely, but rather it is a "karmelit," meaning an area through which passers-by go only occasionally. How could they disagree to this extent? The truth is that they don't argue about the complete courtyard, but only about the area where the wall stood. Rabbi Eliezer says that people now do walk there, and the Sages - that they did not do walk there before and don't really walk there even now.
