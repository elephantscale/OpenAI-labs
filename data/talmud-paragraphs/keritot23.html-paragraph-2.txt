 Rabbi Shimon says that since between the two of them they have certainly committed a transgression, there is no uncertainty here. Rather, they bring a guilt-offering in partnership, and stipulate, "If I am the one who committed misappropriation, this is my offering, but if you did - then I relinquish my ownership, and the offering is yours." Rabbi Yose says that one cannot divide guilt in this manner, and thus the argument reverts back to Rabbi Akiva and the Sages.
