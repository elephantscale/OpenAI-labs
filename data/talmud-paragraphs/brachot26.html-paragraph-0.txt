Brachot 26 - Who Established Prayer? The Shema is followed by the Standing (Amidah) prayer, composed of eighteen blessings. The Standing prayer of the morning can be said until midday. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that its time lasts only until four hours into the morning. But didn't we say that the proper time for morning prayer is at sunrise? - True, this refers to the prayer of the refined ones. But did not Rabbi Yochanan say that one can pray all day? - That is also true, but in that case one only gets the reward for prayer, while the reward for "timely prayer" is not given to him.
