 Dama ben Netinah was a non-Jew who exemplified respect to parents. The Sages wanted to buy from him a gem for the Kohen's breastplate for 600,000 golden coins. He refused, because the key from the jewelry box was under the pillow on which his father was sleeping. Next year, however, a red heifer was born among his cattle. He said to the Sages, "I know that you will pay me any money for it, but I only want the 600,000 that I lost."
