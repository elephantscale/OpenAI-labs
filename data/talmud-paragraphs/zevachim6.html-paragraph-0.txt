Zevachim 6 - Can There Be Forgiveness In Advance? A burnt offering (olah) achieves forgiveness for positive commandments, for example, when one missed saying the "Shema Israel!" prayer in the morning or in the evening, or did not put on teffilin throughout the day. It can atone even for multiple such transgression.
