 From where does Rabbi Akiva derive this most strange fact? - From the words of the Torah, "And the pure will sprinkle upon the impure." The Torah could have said "upon him," why did it have to again emphasize that he was impure? - To tell us that the impure becomes pure, but the pure becomes impure. The Sages say that it would be totally illogical, and as far as the words "on the impure" - they learn a different law from it. But how does Rabbi Akiva answer the logic argument? He says, "Even Solomon could not understand it, as he said, "I wanted to become wise, but it is beyond me."
