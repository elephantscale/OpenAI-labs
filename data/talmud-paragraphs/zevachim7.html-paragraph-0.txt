Zevachim 7 - Thanksgiving Offering Slaughtered as a Thanksgiving Offering of Another What happens when a Kohen slaughters a thanksgiving offering of one person for the sake of thanksgiving of his fellow? This does not mean that he wants the sacrifice of one to become the sacrifice of the other! That would a simple case of change in the ownership of the sacrifice, and it would not be credited to its owner. Rather, the Kohen meant that the offering of one owner should assume the sacred properties of another one, but still belong to the first owner.
