 The Menorah was to be produced from a single block of raw material, and it would be made of gold. If the craftsman made it out of scraps of gold, the Menorah is invalid. In describing the Menorah, the Torah said that it must be "hammered out." An additional word "being" indicates that this requirement is essential. However, if the Menorah was made of other kinds of metals, then it did not have to made out of one piece, and was nevertheless valid.
