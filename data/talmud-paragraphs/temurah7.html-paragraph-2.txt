 What is the source of the opinion of Rabbi Yose? The Torah said, "Any sacrifice which is blemished you shall not offer... any whose testicles are crushed... you shall not offer... from the hand of a stranger you shall not offer." The third "you shall not offer" is extra and applies to another law - receiving the blood. And the first teacher, why doesn't he agree? - He says that this is the normal language of the Torah, and nothing is to be derived from it.
