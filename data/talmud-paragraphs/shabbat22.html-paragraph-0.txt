Shabbat 22 - Hanukkah On the last page the Talmud mentioned Hanukkah, in connection with oils used used on it and on Shabbat. This is the only mention of Hanukkah in the Talmud. What is the reason for Hanukkah? When the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they contaminated all the flasks of oil that were there. When the Hasmoneans gained the upper hand, they searched and found only one flask of oil, with the seal of the High Priest still intact. It contained enough oil for one day. However, a miracle was performed with this oil, and they kindled the lights of the Menorah with it for eight days, until other ritually pure oil could be obtained. The following year the Hasmoneans and the Sanhedrin established these eights days as festival days, to praise God for the miracle.
