Pesachim 30 - Chametz mix If chametz is mixed with some permitted food, it is still prohibited to be eaten on Passover - so says Rav. Of course, if you can feel its taste, it is the same as chametz itself, but Rav refers even to minute amounts. Why doesn't the regular law of nullification of small amounts apply? This is a special decree: since normally people are accustomed to eating chametz, and since eating it leads to being cut off from one's spiritual source, then it is better to distance people from even small admixtures of chametz.
