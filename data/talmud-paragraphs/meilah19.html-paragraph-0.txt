Meilah 19 - How Misappropriations Do Not Combine If one benefited from an article belonging to the Temple in the amount of half a perutah (small coin), and also deteriorated it for half a perutah (for example, he wore a garment for a short time and also tore it while wearing), he has not committed misappropriations. Also, if he used one article but caused deterioration in another - he is still not liable, since both the amount of benefit and of deterioration must be at least a perutah.
