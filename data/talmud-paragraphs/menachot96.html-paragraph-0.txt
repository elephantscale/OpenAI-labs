Menachot 96 - Wafers of the High Priest Each day, the High Priest brought twelve wafers, six in the morning and six in the afternoon. In the morning he would bring and consecrate a full tenth (issaron, or 5-pound measure) of flour and divide it into two halves. Kneading and baking of the wafers was done daily, even on Shabbat, but grinding and sifting of their flour was done before. Rabbi Akiva formulated a rule: "Even when the Torah allowed a labor on Shabbat, it allowed only that portion of it that could not be done before Shabbat."
