 These two practices appear contradictory. If Rav Yehudah thinks that women have to wear tzitzit - and we know that women have to do only the commandments whose time is not fixed - then he must also think that tzitzit has no fixed time and applies both by day and by night. Why did he then say a blessing every morning? - Rav Yehudah recited a blessing every time he donned a garment, much like tefillin. Then let him say it more often! - True, but Rav Yehudah was modest and never undressed during the day, so that changing his night garment was the only time he could say a blessing.
