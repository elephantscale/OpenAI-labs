Shabbat 16 - Glass vessels, what are they? In connection with the preceding discussion of the laws of purity, the Talmud mentions the purity of glassware. Since glassware is not mentioned anywhere in the Torah, it should not be susceptible to ritual impurity. However, the Sages did decree such impurity. Why? Rabbi Yochanan quoted his favorite student Resh Lakish: "Since its formation is from sand, the Sages placed it in the same category as earthenware - which is mentioned in the Torah and is susceptible to impurity, though only from the inside."
