Ketubot 62 - Man's obligations to his wife A husband has to provide his wife with food, clothing, and intimacy. If he quarrels with her and, in his rage, vows to never have relations with her, this vow does not take effect because he cannot take away her right. However, if he phrases his vow as "the pleasure of relations with you is prohibited to me," he has created a prohibition for himself. Since now he is not a good husband, he should divorce her immediately and - because it is his fault - pay her the complete amount of her Ketubah.
