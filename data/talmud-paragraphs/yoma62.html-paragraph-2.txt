 Rabbi Yehudah adds that if the blood of the goat "for God" was spilled, then the one for Azazel cannot be used. And if the one for Azazel dies, then the blood of the one "for God" should be spilled away. We understand the first rule: if the blood is spilled, the mitzvah is not finished and therefore not done at all, so the service cannot proceed. But if one for Azazel dies - well, it was going to be sent to death anyway!? Rabbi Yehudah's view is based on a verse, "It should stand alive in front of God to atone," which means that it should be alive until the service of the other is complete.
