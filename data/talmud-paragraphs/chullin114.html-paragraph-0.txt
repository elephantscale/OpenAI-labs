Chullin 114 - Milk, But Not That of Its Mother From the phrase, "You shall not cook a young goat in the milk of its mother" we only know that it is prohibited to cook it in the milk of a she-goat. How do we know this for the milk of a cow or an ewe? - We can derive this logically: if the young goat's own mother, with whom he can have offspring, is nevertheless so strict that it is prohibited to cook him in its milk, then a cow, with whom he is not allowed to have offspring (for that would be prohibited interbreeding) - her milk certainly cannot be used to cook him!
