Yoma 6 - Why do we separate the High Priest, again? Earlier, we mentioned that for seven days before Yom Kippur, the High Priest is separated into a special chamber, where they teach him the order of the services. Why do we do this? The Talmud asks, what kind of question is that? We already explained: according to Rabbi Yochanan, this is derived from the dedication ceremony, and according to Resh Lakish - from the giving of the Torah. The Talmud then rephrases: why do we separate him from his "house," that is, from his wife? Let her go together with him!
