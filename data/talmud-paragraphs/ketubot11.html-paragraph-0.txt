Ketubot 11 - How much a husband owes to his wife The marriage contract, called Ketubah, obligates the husband to pay his wife 200 zuz upon their divorce or his death. How much is that? The calculation is based on the silver contents of a zuz, subject to the discussion of whether by zuz we mean a pure silver coin or one mixed with seven parts of copper. This amount is estimated today at 100 pounds of silver, or about $25,000. This is roughly the amount one can live on for a year.
