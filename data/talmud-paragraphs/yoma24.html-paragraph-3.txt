 In general, if a non-Kohen performs a Temple service, he is liable to death at the hand of Heaven. However, only a complete, final service carries that responsibility. For example, is a non-Kohen liable for arranging the lamps of the Menora? - No, because there are also wicks. Is he liable or the wicks? - No, because there is also putting them in the lamps? Is he liable for that, then? - No, because there is also putting oil. And he is not liable for it either, because there is also kindling. Then surely he must be liable for kindling!? - No, he just holds a flame to the wick, and the wick ignites by itself.
