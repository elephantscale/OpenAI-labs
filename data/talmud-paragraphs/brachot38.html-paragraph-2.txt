 On vegetables one says "Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the earth." Since this law is taught right after the law of bread, we understand that it refers to cooked vegetables as well. However, others say that cooked vegetables loose their special blessing and get the generic blessing on food, "Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created". Rav Chisda reconciles the two sides: if the vegetable is usually eaten raw and not cooked, then it looses its special blessing. However, if it is usually eaten cooked but not raw, then the raw vegetables gets a generic blessing, and the cooked one - "Who created the fruit of the earth." What is an example of the first? - Garlic.
