 However, if one says, "Give a hundred zuz ($5,000) to a certain person" and then he dies, the heirs are obligated to give the money to the named recipient. This is not obvious at all. There was no act of acquisition, "Give him money" are just words. Once the man dies, normal laws of inheritance should take effect, meaning that his estate goes to his closest relatives. Therefore, Rav wanted to say that perhaps this is only talking about money on the shelf which had previously been given as deposit, or that the man who said these words was dying, and in that special case the money is considered already given, for otherwise the dying person would die even sooner.
