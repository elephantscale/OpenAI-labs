Menachot 19 - Torah Repetitions Emphasize Requirement Rav said, "Wherever the Torah stated 'law' and 'decree', it means to make the step essential, so that if it is omitted, the whole procedure has to be repeated." The Talmud asked Rav questions, based on the laws of Nazir, thanksgiving offering, and Yom Kippur, and changed the understanding of what Rav said to: only 'decree' indicates the requirement, but 'law', although similar, does not.
