Menachot 95 - Where Was the Bread of Vision Baked? When the Jews traveled in the desert, did the Bread of Vision become invalid at the beginning of each journey? Since the the bread was moved from its place, is this the same as leaving the curtains, or does the Tabernacle retain its status to protect the bread from invalidation? Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi argue about this, but we do not know who held what view. Based on the phrase "as they encamp so shall they journey," the bread in travel becomes invalid just as in the encampment, but based on "and the constant bread shall remain upon the table," the bread remains valid.
