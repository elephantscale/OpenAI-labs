Sukkah 50 - Which is the essential part, vocal or instrumental? The flute was played in the Temple during the nights of Sukkot. It served as a musical accompaniment before the drawing of the water for libation. Since it was not played on Shabbat or Festivals, sometimes it worked out to five days of flute playing and sometimes six.
