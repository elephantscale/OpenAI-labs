 The snake was cursed more than all the beasts, and its pregnancy lasts seven times longer than that of a donkey, that is, seven years. Caesar said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananya, "How long is the gestation of a snake?" Rabbi Yehoshua answered, "Seven years." Caesar then said, "But the philosophers of Athens mated the snakes, and they bore young only after three years!" Rabbi Yehoshua answered, "Those snakes had already been pregnant four years before the Athenians began to study them." Caesar was not satisfied, "But these snakes copulated when mated by the Athenians, so they could not be pregnant!" Rabbi Yehoshua answered, "The snakes copulate even during pregnancy, as do people." The Caesar said, "But the Athenians are wise, and can be trusted in their scientific findings!" Rabbi Yehoshua answered, "We the Jewish Sages are wiser than they."
