Arachin 16 - What To Do About Bad Talk? About the one who talks badly of his fellow, God says, "He who slanders his neighbor in secret... him I cannot bear." What's the correction? If he is a scholar, he should learn Torah and books on self-improvement, and if he can't learn, he should become humble. Rav Acha said, "There is no correction for bad things that were already said. This advice is for one who wants to protect himself from speaking badly."
