Pesachim 116 - Second cup of wine After the first cup of wine at the Seder, they immediately pour the second one. Now the curiosity of his son is aroused, and he is supposed to ask, "What is so different about this night that you are drinking a second cup of wine, without having even eaten?" If the son is not observant enough to notice, his wife asks him the same question. And that is the question that he was waiting for, for now, he can plunge into the Haggadah, which providers the answer: "It is because we were slaves once, and now we are free to do as we please and to server our Creator!"
