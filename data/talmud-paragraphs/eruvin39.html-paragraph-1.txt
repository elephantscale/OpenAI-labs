 If one wants to wants to go beyond two thousands steps in different directions on two days of Rosh Hashanah - he can, provided that he places his eruv food in appropriate places, since after all, only one day is the real festival - this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages agree that it is one festival, but they argue that its long-term observance for two days made both days into one long Rosh HaShanah, so that he cannot have two different eruvs.
