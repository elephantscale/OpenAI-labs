 In the early days, they would start the festival meal with wine and desserts, then continue with the meal, also accompanied by wine, and then again serve more wine with desserts after the meal has ended. One who said a blessing on the wine before the meal would also include the after-meal wine in this blessing, because these two went together. However, he did not include the wine that came during the meal, because that wine had a different purpose - it came for the food courses in the meal.
