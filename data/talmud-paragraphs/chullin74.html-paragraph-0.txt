Chullin 74 - Calf of a Slaughtered Cow If one slaughters a cow pregnant with an eight-month calf, alive or dead, or a dead nine-month calf, it may be killed and eaten without shechitah, even after it grows up. This rule is the subject of the last few pages, but the Talmud first discusses the exceptions to it, and now quotes the rule itself. It is also restated to introduce the dissenting opinion of Rabbi Meir.
