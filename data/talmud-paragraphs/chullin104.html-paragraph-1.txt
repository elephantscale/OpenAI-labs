 Beit Shammai allows to place chicken and cheese on the same table, provided that they are not eaten together. Rabbi Yose says that this is one of the unusual leniences of Beit Shammai over Beit Hillel. In truth, Rabbi Yose is the author of this complete ruling, but initially it was taught anonimously. When the teacher learned who was its author, he added Rabbi Yose's name, because one who transmits a teaching in the name of the one who said it saves the world - just as Esther did when she told the king about a plot against him in the name of Mordechai.
