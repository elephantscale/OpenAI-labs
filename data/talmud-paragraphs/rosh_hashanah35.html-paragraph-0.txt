Rosh Hashanah 35 - Who has to pray? The prayer is said by everyone silently, and then it is repeated by the prayer leader. However, Rabban Gamliel states that the prayer leader's words count as the prayer for everyone so that everyone else does not have to pray. This is true throughout the year, and even more so on Rosh Hashanah when the prayer is long and was unfamiliar to many, especially when there were no printed prayer books.
