 The feast that Abraham made when Isaac was weaned ("gamal") is indicative of the future feast where the righteous will celebrated the kindness ("gomel") of God. In the end, they will give Abraham the cup and ask him to recite the blessing over the meal. But he will refuse, saying that Ishmael issued from him. They will ask Isaac, and he will refuse because of Esau. Jacob - because he married two sisters. Moses - because he did not enter Israel. Joshua - because he did not have a son. However, David will accept, saying that it indeed fits for him to bless. Why? Because in the psalms, he said, "I will raise the cup of salvation, and I will invoke the name of God."
