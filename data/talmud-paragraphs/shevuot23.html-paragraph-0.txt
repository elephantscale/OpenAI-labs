Shevuot 23 - Not To Eat Bread! If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat!" - and then he ate wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread - he is liable for only one offering. But if he swore, "An oath that I will not eat wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread!" - and then he ate all three - he is liable for each one.
