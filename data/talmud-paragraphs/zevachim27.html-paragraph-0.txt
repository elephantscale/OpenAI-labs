Zevachim 27 - If the Blood was Applied in the Wrong Place If the blood of a sacrifice was applied in the wrong place, for example, blood that was supposed to be on the upper part of the Altar was applied to the lower part, or vice versa, or if the blood that was supposed to be sprinkled within the Hall of the Temple was applied outside, that is, in the Courtyard, or vice versa, the sacrifice is invalid, but eating its meat does not bear the penalty of being cut off from the people.
