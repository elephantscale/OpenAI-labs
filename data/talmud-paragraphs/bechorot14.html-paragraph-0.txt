Bechorot 14 - Consecrating Animals with a Blemish An offering must be without blemish, and even consecrating a blemished animal is forbidden. Actually, if one consecrates a blemished animal as a sacrifice, no consecration occurs at all, but if he says, "I am consecrating this blemished animal in order that it be sold, and a sacrifice brought with the money," then, although he violated a prohibition, the animal needs to be redeemed.
