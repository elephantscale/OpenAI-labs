Shevuot 24 - Eating Unkosher Meat on Yom Kippur When one eats meat of an animal that was not properly slaughtered (neveilah) on Yom Kippur, this is an example of an inclusive prohibition. This meat was already prohibited to him before Yom Kippur. Now that Yom Kippur came, it brought with itself an all-inclusive prohibition to eat this and other foods. The Sages make him liable for two prohibitions: eating unkosher meat and eating on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon, however, does not agree to the principle of inclusive prohibition and makes him liable only for eating unkosher meat.
