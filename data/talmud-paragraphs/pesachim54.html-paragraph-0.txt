Pesachim 54 - What happened after Shabbat Right after the first Shabbat, Adam was granted an extra measure of understanding, and he created fire. To commemorate this, people light a candle with multiple wicks and enjoy its light. The Talmud discusses ten things that were created before Shabbat, such as Miriam's well, the manna, the script, the mouth of Balaam's donkey. Incidentally, seven things are concealed from people, among them the day of death, the day when one's depression will lift, the knowledge of other's thoughts, what business one will be successful in, and when the Messiah will come.
