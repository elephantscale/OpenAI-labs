 It once happened that they reaped Rav's harvest on the holiday weekdays. When Shmuel heard about it, he was upset. Why? The prevailing law is that one is permitted to harvest if it will spoil! - This was wheat, and it would not spoil. Then why did Rav allow it? - Because Rav had otherwise nothing to eat. If so, why was Shmuel upset? - Because he did not know that Rav had nothing to eat. Some say Shmuel knew that, but he considered it more proper for Rav to borrow and later repay.
