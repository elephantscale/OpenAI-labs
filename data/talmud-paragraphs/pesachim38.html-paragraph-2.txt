 The Torah said, "Watch your matzah," that is, guard it for the sake of the Seder. If he prepared the matzah for himself, he watched it for a Nazirite, not for the Seder - thus, he cannot eat it. But if he prepared it for others, he had a thought in the back of his mind that if he cannot find buyers, he will use it for the Seder. Therefore, he watched with the intention of possibly using it for Seder, and now he can indeed eat it.
