 But is it true that one who cannot talk can't learn? Why, two mute brothers always attended the lessons of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, nodded in agreement, moved their lips. In the end, Rabbi Yehudah prayed for them, and they recovered, and it was found out that they knew all parts of the Torah!? Correct, but the purpose of learning is also teaching, and a mute cannot teach.
