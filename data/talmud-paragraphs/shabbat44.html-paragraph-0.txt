Shabbat 44 - A new lamp, but not the old one A new clean lamp may be handled on Shabbat. Since one can use it for something else, like storing objects, it is not considered, "muktzeh," or set aside. However, once it has been used, it becomes dirty, and one cannot store anything in it. True, it is usable as a lamp, but kindling it is exactly what is prohibited on Shabbat. It follows then that a used lamp may not be handled on Shabbat.
