 "Swallowed-up impurity" is a ritually impure object enclosed in a hidden bodily cavity, such as the stomach. This impurity is considered non-existent. "Concealed place impurity" is a ritually impure object places in a partly concealed such as an ear, nostril, or armpit. What is the status of a ritually impure object in "that place" of a woman? The Talmud asks, what's the difference? And it answers, swallowed-up impurity has no effect at all, but concealed-place impurity makes one who carries it impure. So if her friend inserted a peace of nevelah meat there, her ritual purity status would depend on the answer to this question. Rava said, "It is swallowed up, and she is pure," while Abaye said, "It is concealed, and she is impure when she moves."
