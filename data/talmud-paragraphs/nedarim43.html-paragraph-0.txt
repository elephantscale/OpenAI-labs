Nedarim 43 - Vagaries of vows If A is prohibited by a vow to receive any benefit from B, and then A does not have what to eat, what is B to do if he wants to feed A? B can go to a storekeeper whom he frequents and tell him, "A does not have what to eat, and I don't know what to do about it." The storekeeper can take the hint and feed A, and B can then repay him. This is allowed since B never explicitly promised to repay, so the storekeeper acts on his own accord.
