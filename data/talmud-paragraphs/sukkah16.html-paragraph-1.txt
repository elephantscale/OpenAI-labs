 If one hollows up a cavity under a haystack to use it as a sukkah, it is not valid because this hay was already there before, and he did make it for the sukkah. However, if initially, someone left even a small opening under the hay, then he can dig some more and live there: the initial opening qualified as a sukkah - if it was constructed for shade - and he just completed the necessary height.
