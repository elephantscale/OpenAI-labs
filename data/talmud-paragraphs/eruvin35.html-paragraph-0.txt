Eruvin 35 - Eruv in a closet If one locked his eruv food in a closet and then lost the key, the eruv is still valid. But why? It is not accessible! - It is a closet made of bricks, and he can break it, and in this way get to his food. But then he is demolishing, and that is prohibited on Shabbat!? - The closet is not cemented, it is just bricks put together.
