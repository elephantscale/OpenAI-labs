Bava Metzia 108 - The Right of the Adjoining Property Holder An immediate neighbor of a property has the right of first purchase to it. An outsider who wants to buy a field can easily find another one, but a neighbor gains significantly from being able to buy an adjoining field. This rule is based on "You shall do what is right and good in the eyes of Godâ€¦" which commands one to go beyond the letter of the law.
