 Someone who is seriously ill has the same laws as a healthy person, and his sickbed will is invalid. Rather, he must gift his possessions in the regular way, that is, with money, a document, or an act of ownership for land, and with pulling to oneself for movables - this is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi Elazar disputes the principle discussed on the previous twenty pages that a seriously ill person can effect the transfer of his property.
