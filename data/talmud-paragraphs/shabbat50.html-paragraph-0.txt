Shabbat 50 - Are branches prepared to sit on them on Shabbat? It happened once that Rav Chanina ben Akiva came to a certain place and found branches of date palms that were harvested for firewood. He told his students, "Go and mentally designate these branches for us, so that we may sit on them tomorrow (on Shabbat)." Zeiri, who was retelling this episode, added, "And I don't know if it was for the house of feasting (wedding) or for the house of mourning."
