 One day Runia was harvesting dates in his field. Ravina sent his sharecropper to take a cluster of dates, and Runia shouted at him. Ravina said, "You have shown that you want the dates to be protected. "They went to Rava's court. Rava said to Runia, "If you want to settle for what Ravina offered - good, and if not, you will have to pay half of the real cost of the fence."
