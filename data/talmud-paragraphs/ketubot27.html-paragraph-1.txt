 This rule does not seem to agree with another law about soldiers: if a marauding troop came to a city, then in the time of peace, open barrels are prohibited, but closed ones are still permitted - since it is presumed that the soldiers drank from the open ones and made libations. However, at the time of war, all barrels are permitted - because the soldiers do not have time to turn away to wine. We see then that the soldiers are busy with war! - True, they won't have the time for wine, but they will have the time for women.
