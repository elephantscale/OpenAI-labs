Nazir 32 - They knew when the Temple would be destroyed If one became a nazir but kept drinking wine - hoping, perhaps, that his vow would be annulled - but a Sage affirmed his vow - he continues his period of being a nazir and finishes it. However, the Sages imposed upon him a penalty: he cannot even ask about annulment until he behaves appropriately for as many days as he previously violated by drinking wine. Suppose a Sage annulled his vow of being a nazir, and he already separated an animal for the concluding sacrifices. In that case, we are back to the argument between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel simply allow the animal to go back to its flock.
