Eruvin 10 - Post Up until now we discussed one way of making carrying permitted in an alley - by placing a crossbeam over the top of its entrance. There is another way, however: a post. This post is placed next to the alley's exit, and it serves the same purpose: either it reminds the residents of alley's courtyards that the alley is different from the street, or it serves as the beginning of the fourth wall, separating the alley from the street.
