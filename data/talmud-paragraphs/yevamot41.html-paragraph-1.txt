 Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: people won't be confused. So he allows, for example, a betrothed girl whose groom died to get married to another man right away. Similarly, a married woman can get engaged and wait three months for the chuppah. The exception is a betrothed girl in the province of Yehudah, where it was known that the grooms may have been too familiar with their brides.
