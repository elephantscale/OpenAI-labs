Chullin 81 - Unfit Slaughter Is No Slaughter At All! If the shechitah did not allow for the meat of the animal to be eaten, then Rabbi Shimon does not consider this act as shechitah. Therefore, if one made a shechitah but found that the animal was a terefah anyway, or if he slaughtered an idolatrous sacrifice, or a bull sentenced to be stoned for goring, a red heifer, or a calf designated to be decapitated to atone for a unresolved murder case, and then slaughtered its offspring, then according to Rabbi Shimon he is not liable for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day.
