 However, in this rule, we have a mixture of different opinions. First, one says that the High Priest can have up to half of the total - based on the Torah's phrase, "To Aaron and his sons," which is understood as "half to Aaron and half to his sons." Another opinion is that he takes less than half - that is the "four or five" out of twelve. However, it could also be that all agree that he takes less than half; as far as one loaf on Shavuot - it would not be polite to break it. There is also an opinion that two of the twelve loaves of bread of vision are given as a reward for the closing of the gates, and the remaining ten are divided between the rest - this explains the "four" as less than half of ten.
