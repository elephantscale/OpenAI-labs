Taanit 28 - The fast of the seventeenth of Tamuz On the seventeenth of the month of Tamuz, five bad things happened in Jewish history, and five other things happened on Tisha B'Av. Both days are commemorated by fasting. These days are three weeks apart; Lamentations hints at this by saying, "All her pursuers overtook her within the straits." What are the five bad things? Moses broke the Tablets of the Covenant. The Talmud makes the calculation: Moses went up the Mount Sinai and got the Tablets, spent forty days learning the Torah, and came down when he heard the Jews worshiping the Golden Calf. This day was the seventeenth of Tamuz. Other events were: the invading Roman army breached the walls of Jerusalem; a Greek general, Apostumos, burned the Torah scroll written by Ezrah the Prophet and put idols in the Temple.
