 If one fears bandits, he still may not extinguish the Shabbat lamp, but if he did so, he has not transgressed the Torah. The same is true if he needs to extinguish it so that a sick person would sleep. If he extinguishes the lamp to save the oil, he is liable. However, Rabbi Yose says that extinguishing is not a constructive labor to be liable for it on Shabbat, and that he is liable only if he wants to improve the wick by charring it for the next time.
