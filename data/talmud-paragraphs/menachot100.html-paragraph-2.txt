 From the words of Rabbi Yose we learn that if one learns a little Torah in the morning and a little in the evening, he fulfills "the Torah shall not depart from your mouth," and even if he just reads the "Sh'ma," but we don't tell this to the unlearned. Rava said, "It is a mitzvah to tell it to them."
