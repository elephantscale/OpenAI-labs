 Actually, there is no problem. Who wrote down the rules (Mishna?) - this is Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. In the laws of Shabbat, when cooking is not allowed, and people are naturally more careful, he formulated the rules leniently. But in the laws of Yom Tov, where cooking is allowed, and people may extend the permissions even further, he formulated the rules more stringently.
