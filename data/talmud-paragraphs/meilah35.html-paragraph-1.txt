They would turn to the left, and immediately evoke the compassion of the onlookers, who would say to the mourners, "May the One Who dwells in this House console you." If he told them that he was excommunicated, they would say to him, "May the One Who dwells in this House instill compassion in the judges' hearts," - these are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yehudah said to him, "You have made the judges out as if they overstepped the bounds of the law." Rather, they said to him, "May the One Who dwells in this House put reason into your heart, and you listen to the words of your colleagues."
