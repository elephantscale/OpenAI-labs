 Why did the Torah mentioned "trapping," since fowl don't need to be trapped? To teach that one should eat meat only occasionally, as if he had to trap it each and every time. Additionally, one should only eat meat if he has a great desire for it, has flocks, or is otherwise rich. Others should eat it only on Shabbat. However, later generations became weaker and should eat whatever is necessary to maintain their health.
