 When the Ark was in existence, its two poles protruded from behind the Curtain as two breasts of a woman, and that is what King Solomon meant when he said, "A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, lodged between my breasts." A similar symbol was represented by the Cherubim, who were in a shape of a man and a woman joined in an embrace. At the time of the Temple destruction, the enemy soldiers entered the Temple, saw this, and said, "These Jews, who possess the power of blessing and curse, should occupy themselves with such pictures!" This is what Jeremiah meant when he said, "All who once respected her, now debased her, for they saw her nakedness."
