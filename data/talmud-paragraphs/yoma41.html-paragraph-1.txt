 The last words "opposite a place of slaughtered" are intentionally ambiguous: it may mean next to the area where it is slaughtered, or it may mean that the strip of wool is tied next to the place of the cut in slaughter. The Talmud concludes that it is the latter; this was done so that the High Priest can tell this goat apart from all the other ones. This conclusion will change on the next page where Rabbi Yochanan does not mention the strip of wool that would go on the goat's throat.
