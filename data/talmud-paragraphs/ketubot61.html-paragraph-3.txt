 There was once a Roman who wanted to marry a particular woman, but she refused. He started eating pomegranates in front of her, and as she swallowed the saliva produced by her desire for it, she finally became all bloated. He made her promise that if he cured her, she would marry him. Then he brought more pomegranates and started eating these, saying, "All saliva that causes you discomfort, spit it out, spit it out!" She did so until something like a green palm leaf shot out of her, and she became healed.
