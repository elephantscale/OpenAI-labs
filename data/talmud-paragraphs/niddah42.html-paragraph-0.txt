Niddah 42 - Meat in the Mouth If a woman emits the man's semen in the next three days after cohabitation, she is ritually impure, just as he was. However, while his impurity comes when the semen leaves his body, her impurity comes while the semen is on its way out, even before it leaves her body. Why? About the blood the Torah said, "in her flesh" - that is, already in her flesh, before it leaves the body, and about semen it said, "it will be," giving it the same law. However, Rabbi Shimon says that her law should be just like his, that is, she does not become ritually impure until his semen actually leaves her body.
