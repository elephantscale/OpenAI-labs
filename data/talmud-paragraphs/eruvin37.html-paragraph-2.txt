 He then drinks the wine on Shabbat and leaves over the necessary amounts. Every drop that is left now was present somewhere in the barrel on Friday, so we can say that this same drop was designated as tithe on Friday. Thus the future event of leaving some wine over determines the past designation of this wine as tithe. This principle is called "bereirah," or "clarification", and it is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. However, the other Sages did not agree with Rabbi Meir, asking him "What if the barrel breaks? He will have drunk untithed wine!" Rabbi Meir answered, "When it breaks, then we will worry about it." What he really meant is that one can appoint a guardian to protect it. And the Sages? They say that the guardian himself may fall asleep, thus he needs another guardian, and so on, without end.
