 There was also another festival in Rome. Once in seventy years they would take a healthy person - representing Esau - and have him ride upon the shoulders of a lame person, representing Jacob. They would dress the upper man in the attire of Adam, the first man, which he had used for hunting, and they would put the scalp of Rabbi Ishmael on his head. They would declare, "The calculations of the ruler (Jacob) are wrong," (which meant that the Jews still have not been redeemed). The brother (Jacob) of our lord (Esau) is a cheat; woe to one of them when the other one arises."
