Meilah 15 - How Misappropriations Combine Items consecrated to be brought on the Altar combine with one another for misappropriation. For example, if one ate half an olive volume of meat of an animal sacrifice, and another half an olive volume from another, he committed misappropriation, because he ate an olive volume of Temple's property. Additionally, if those half-olive volumes were of sacrifices left beyond permitted time, and he ate the total volume of an olive, he is liable to be cut off from his spiritual source. Two half-olive volumes of something fit for Temple treasury but not for the Altar also combine. Finally, even meat of a sacrifice and meat consecrated to the Treasury, also combine with one another for prohibition.
