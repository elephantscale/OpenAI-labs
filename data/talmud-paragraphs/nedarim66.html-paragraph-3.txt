 Rabbi Ishmael takes this further: even if she was ugly and was made beautiful - so that this is something unforeseen, not something that he did not realized - his vow can still be annulled. Once a man vowed that he will not marry his niece because she was ugly (she had a bad-looking false tooth). Rabbi Ishmael paid the dentist to fix it, provided beautiful clothes to her, and then asked the man, "Is it this one that you vowed against?" The man said, "Had I known that she will be so beautiful, I would never have taken the vow!" Rabbi Ishmael cried and said, "All daughters of Israel are beautiful, it is only poverty that makes them sometimes homely."
