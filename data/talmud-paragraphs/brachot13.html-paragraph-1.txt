 If one happened to be reading the "Shema" - "Listen, Israel" in the Torah, at exactly the moment when the time to read this as a prayer arrived, does it count for him as prayer, or will he have to read it again? - That depends. If he had in mind, it counts, and if not, it does not. Does this mean in general that one has to be conscious of his doing a mitzvah, and only then it counts? - Not necessarily. Perhaps "having it in mind" does not mean "to fulfill his prayer obligation" but simply means that he is conscious that he is saying the words. How can one not be conscious if he is talking? - If he is reading the letters to verify the spelling in the Torah scroll.
