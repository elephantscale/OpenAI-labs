Chullin 41 - A Person Cannot Forbid Something That Is Not His If an idolater performed a libation with a Jew's wine, but did it not in front of an idol, then Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehudah ben Bava say that the wine remains kosher, for two reasons: libations are normally done in front of an idol, and moreover, a person cannot forbid something that is not his. This point of view argues against what Rav Huna said about slaughter in front of idol.
