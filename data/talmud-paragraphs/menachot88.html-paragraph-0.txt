Menachot 88 - Seven Measures for Liquids There were seven types of measures for liquids in the Temple, based on a measure of "hin" (twelve login, or about 1 gallon): a hin, half-hin, third-of-a-hin, quarter-in, log, half-log, and a quarter-log. Rabbi Shimon says that the hin was not there, because only Moses used it, and then only once, but others claim that they kept Moses' hin. All that is based on the tradition that one needs seven liquid measures, and the measures have to be full. Rabbi Elazar bar Tzadok say that there was only one hin-measure, with incremental markings. He does not agree to the tradition of "seven measures."
