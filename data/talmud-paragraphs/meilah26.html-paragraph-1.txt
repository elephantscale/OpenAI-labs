 At what time did the appointed Kohen arrive? Sometimes a little before and sometimes a little after the rooster's cry. He would knock upon the Temple gates, and they would open it for him. He would say to them, "Whoever has immersed himself should come and participate in the lottery." They made a lottery (we will learn about this in the tractate Yoma), and whoever won, won.
