 The stork in Hebrew is "racham," which connotes mercy - because it is a harbinger of rain. Rav Bibi bar Abaye said, "That is only when it sits on something makes the 'sherakrak' sound. If it sits on the ground and shrieks, it is a sign that Messiah is about to come." But there was one stork that settled in a plowed field and shrieked, and a stone came down and cracked its skull?! - That one was a liar.
