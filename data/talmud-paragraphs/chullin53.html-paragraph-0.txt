Chullin 53 - The One That is Clawed A small (sparrow) hawk can render small fowl terefah by clawing them, and a large hawk (falcon) can do it to large fowl. Clawing makes an animal terefah only if done with the foreleg, not hind leg and not a tooth, and not if the paw was severed before the predator drew it back.
