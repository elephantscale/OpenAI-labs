 If one who had an emission went to a mikveh just before the ideal time to say the Shema - sunrise - then if he is able to get out of the water, cover himself, and recite the Shema - he should do it. However, if the time passes, he should "cover himself with water," that is, stand with only his head above the water, and say Shema that way. But we know that the one is allowed to say the morning Shema much later, until the three hours into the day, why is he rushing? - He decided to do the "prayer of the refined" today, and that gives him the right to rush.
