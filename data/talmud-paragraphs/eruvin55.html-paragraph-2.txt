 Rabbi Preida had a student to whom he would have to repeat the lesson four hundred times before he understood it. One day, Rabbi Preida had to go to do a mitzvah, so he taught the student the usual four hundred times and was preparing to leave, when the student told him that he did not understand it this time, since every minute he was saying to himself, "Soon my teacher will leave." Rabbi Preida said, "Sit and I will teach you," and taught him another four hundred times. A heavenly voice asked him, "Do you want that four hundred years be added to your life, or that you and your generation merit the life in the World to Come?" Rabbi Preida chose the World to Come, but God himself intervened and said, "Give him both."
