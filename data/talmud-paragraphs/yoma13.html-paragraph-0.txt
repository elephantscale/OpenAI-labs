Yoma 13 - Another wife for the High Priest Just as they prepare a substitute Kohen for the High Priest, they prepare a substitute wife for him - if his wife will die. Since the Torah said, "He will atone for himself and his house (euphemism for wife)" - he must have one - this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages, however, say that if so, they would have to prepare another wife, and another wife, and so on, to no end - therefore, conclude the Sages, they don't prepare a second wife for him.
