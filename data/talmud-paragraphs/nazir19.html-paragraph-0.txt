Nazir 19 - Deriving different things from the same word A nazir is forbidden to visit a cemetery. Suppose he accidentally comes in contact with a dead body and thus becomes ritually impure. In that case, he needs to purify himself, shave all his hair, bring sacrifices, and restart being a nazir. Say he became impure again the night before he could bring the sacrifices. Then later, he will need to bring two sets of sacrifices. Why? - The Torah said, "He shall sanctify his head on that day and restart being a nazir" - even if he did not bring his sacrifices yet. Thus the new impurity happens to a fresh new nazir and causes another obligation.
