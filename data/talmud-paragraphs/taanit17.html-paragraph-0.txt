Taanit 17 - Why do Kohanim drink wine? A Kohen who is drunk cannot serve in the Temple. Since the Temple can be rebuilt any day, it follows that a Kohen who knows the day when he would be officiating in the Temple should not drink wine on that day. He should also not drink wine the week that he knows would be his week to serve. And since no Kohen today knows his lineage and Temple schedule, no Kohen should ever drink wine.
