 If the defendant says, "I will not swear," he is immediately excused from court, owes money, and does not come back to change his opinion. However, if he says, "I shall swear," those standing there recite the phrase "Turn away from the tents of these wicked men." Even the plaintiff is considered guilty for causing an oath, since he should not have dealt with an untrustworthy person.
