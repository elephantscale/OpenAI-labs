 The libations of lambs may be mixed with the libations of other lambs. These contain three logs (one-and-a-half cup) of oil per issaron of flour. One can even mix the libations of private individual's lamb with the libations of a communal lamb, and even those of today with those of tomorrow - as long as they did not get sanctified in a vessel.
