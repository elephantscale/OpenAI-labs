 After many more similar predictions Rava started giving him money, and Bar Hedya started giving him favorable interpretations. One day he predicted that a miracle will happen to Rava. As they were traveling on a ship, Bar Hedya decided to disembark, since he reasoned that a miracle might not happen to him, and in doing so dropped his manual of dream interpretations, where Rava saw a rule that "dreams follow the interpretation." He then told Bar Hedya, "So you did all of that!? I forgive you all, except for the death of my wife. May your fall into the hands of a power that will have no pity on you."
