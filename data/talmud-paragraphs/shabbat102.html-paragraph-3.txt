 How much does one have to build on Shabbat to be liable? - Any amount. How can any amount of building be useful? - A poor may build a small hole to keep is money in it. Corresponding to this, they would store needles in the Temple's curtain. - No, that's a bad example, because we have a Temple rule: "There is no show of poverty in the place of opulence." Rather, a poor may want to fix a very small hole. And what would be a similar labor in the Temple? - They would fix a small hole in a beam that a worm has eaten - because all prohibited Shabbat work has its source in the building of the Temple.
