 What about someone who never even knew about Shabbat, like a child who was taken away in captivity when he was very young, or one who converts to Judaism on his own accord, without any Jews around to tell him about Shabbat? He did not forget, rather, he never knew! Still, Rav and Shmuel both say that he is responsible for one sacrifice for all his actions.
