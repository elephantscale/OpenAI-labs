 Anything that is subject to pe'ah (leaving over the corners of a field for the poor) is also subject to tithing, but there are things that are subject to pe'ah but not to tithing, that is, figs and vegetables. Why not these? Because pe'ah is only left from food that is collected in one harvest (not figs) and that does not spoil when stored (not vegetables).
