Keritot 21 - Why Is Consuming Blood Prohibited The Torah said, "Do not eat any blood, whether from a mammal or a bird, no matter where you may live." However, that only concerns the blood of animals, who walk on four legs. How do we know the law regarding blood of those who walk on two legs (humans), the blood of eggs (either chicken eggs or testicles), and blood of creepy crawlies (such as rats)? After all, humans are fundamentally different from animals in that they transmit severe ritual purity when dead, while animal meat can transmit only the light impurity of foods.
