 That was the question posed by Rabbah. Abaye asked - for what practical purpose are we asking? If it is for a Kohen to allow him to bury her if she dies - the answer is clear: even for a real engaged bride, a Kohen is not allowed to go to the cemetery, and certainly not for one with whom there is only an intent to marry. And if the question is, do we need a chuppah marriage ceremony, then the answer is clear also: he could do a yibum even against her will, so now that he made a declaration, does it make it any worse? Of course, he does not need a chuppah!
