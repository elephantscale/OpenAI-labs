Shabbat 7 - Special area called "karmelit" Earlier we learned that there special areas on Shabbat which are neither public nor private, such as the sea. It is not private, because it is not surrounded by walls. Neither it is public, because public does not walk there. The Sages prohibited carrying objects on Shabbat in such areas, but since it is not a Torah prohibition, one is not liable for a sacrifice or a punishment if he carries there. Such areas are called "karmelit." What is the etymology of this word? Some say that it means "great forest." Others say that it means "ripe grain," which is in the intermediate state of being neither too moist nor too dry.
