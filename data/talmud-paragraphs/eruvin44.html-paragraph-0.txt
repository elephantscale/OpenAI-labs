Eruvin 44 - Human fence Nechemyah, the son of Rabbi Chanilai, became so engrossed in the contemplation of his learning that he walked out of his residence area (techum). Now all he could walk was four steps around him, and he was not permitted to go back to his town or to his home. When Rav Chisda heard of this, he was talking to Rav Nachman, and said, "Nechemyah, your student, is in suffering." Rav Nachman replied, "Make a human fence - that is, line up people to create a corridor, and he will be able to enter back into his techum through it.
