 Perhaps it is because a nazir is not allowed to bury even his father, and maybe for a non-Jew, it is different? - Can't be because inheritance laws apply to all people, including inheriting from the father. Or perhaps it is because a nazir should avoid impurity, and a non-Jew, since he does not go to the Temple and does not have the concept of impurity, cannot be a nazir? - No, that is not convincing either: perhaps he does have a concept of impurity, just that he gets no punishment for being impure!?
