Zevachim 115 - When Sacrificing Outside is Permitted One is not liable for burning outside those parts of the sacrifices that are eaten and do not go on the Altar. One is also not liable for actions that are not the last step in the service, thus, for example, one is not liable for separating a handful from the flour-offering, but is liable for burning it. Likewise, one is not liable for receiving the blood, but is liable for throwing it on the altar.
