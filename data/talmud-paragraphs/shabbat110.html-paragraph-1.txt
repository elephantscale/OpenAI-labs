 What is a cure for a one who drank water left uncovered? - It is made of a tree used for shepherd's staff. If one does not have it, he should take five roses and five cups of beer, and boil them together. A certain man drank uncovered water. The mother of Rav Achadvoi cooked roses in beer and made him drink it in a hot oven, and poison came out of him like a green leaf of a palm branch.
