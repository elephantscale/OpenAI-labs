Menachot 100 - Replacing the Bread of Vision Four priests would enter the Sanctuary, two carried the two stacks of bread, and the other had the two spoons filled with frankincense. Four more priest preceded them to remove the bread. The ones with the new bread stood in the north, which is more holy, and as the other ones pulled the bread from the table, the new bread was placed on it, hand-breadth by hand-breadth, to fulfill the obligation of the bread being "before Me, continuously."
