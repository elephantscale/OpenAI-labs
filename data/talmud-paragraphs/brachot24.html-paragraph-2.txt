 Rabbi Chanina said, "I saw that during his Standing prayer Rabbi Yehudah the Prince belched, yawned, sneezed, and spat upon the ground." How was he allowed to do this? - Belching and yawning are indeed allowed if done involuntarily, provided that when yawning one covers his mouth. Sneezing - if it is a euphemism for passing wind, then indeed it is not allowed, but sneezing with one's nose is actually a good sign: just as he got relief in this world, so he will get relief in the next one. Spitting is allowed if it bothers him and he does not have napkin, and even then, he should spit to the back of himself, and pause after it.
