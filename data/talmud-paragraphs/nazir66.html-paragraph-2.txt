 The same Sages agree on something else, though. Rabbi Yose says that the one who responds with "Amen" (which signals his agreement to the blessing) is greater than the one who says the blessing. Rabbi Nehorai said, "By Heaven, so it is! Look at a battle: regular soldiers start, but champions seal the battle." And yet, another Sage disagrees and says that one should rush to say the blessing first because he is then blessed from Heaven first - and afterward, the one who answers "Amen" receives the same reward (but not greater).
