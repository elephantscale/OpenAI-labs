Sanhedrin 94 - Chizkiah and Sancheiriv Why is Chizkiah called by this name? Because he strengthened (chizek) the heart of Israel toward their Father in Heaven. What did he do? He thrust a sword near the entrance to the study hall and said, "Whoever does not engage in Torah study will be pierced by this sword." He then supplied the oil for lighting the study halls. They searched in all of Israel and could not find one unlearned person not well versed in Torah. Then they searched within the territory of Judah, and could not find even a young boy or girl, man or woman, who was not well-versed in the most intricate laws of ritual purity. In this generation people neglected their most valuable land because of the Torah study.
