Niddah 11 - Checks Earlier we said that a woman with a fixed period is presumed ritually pure, and the sacrificial foods that she handled prior to seeing discharged blood are not declared impure retroactively. And yet, even such woman, if she handles ritually pure foods, has to examine herself at regularly scheduled times, morning and evening. The exceptions to this rule are a woman who had a discharge (niddah) and is waiting to become pure by going to a mikvah, and the one who is, on the contrary, pure after having given birth.
