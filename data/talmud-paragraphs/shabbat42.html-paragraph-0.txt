Shabbat 42 - From the frying pan into the fire When one pours hot water into cold water, we have this question: does the hot water cook the cold water (which would be forbidden), or does the cold water cool the hot water (and it's allowed). Here we apply the universal principle that "the lower one rules," with the result that pouring into cold water is permitted, but not the other way around. The Talmud makes further distinctions regarding the relative amounts of water.
