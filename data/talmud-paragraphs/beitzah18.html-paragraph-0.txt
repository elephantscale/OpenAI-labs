Beitzah 18 - Purifying for the Holiday Before the Holiday (Yom Tov), one must try to purify himself by immersing in a mikveh - because of the multiple sacrifices brought on the Yom Tov. He must also purify utensils. However, if the Yom Tov follows Shabbat, everything must be purified before Shabbat, saying Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel basically agrees, only they make an exception for the person himself and allow him to go to the mikveh even on Shabbat.
