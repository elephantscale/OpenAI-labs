Niddah 24 - Child with Wings If a woman gives birth to a child with a serious defect, and the defect is such that an animal with a similar defect would not be viable, that is, would be a terefah, then this is not considered a viable child, and the woman does not have the birth-impurity. There is, however, a point of view that an animal that is terefah actually can survive. According to this view, the child is viable, and the mother has the impurity of childbirth.
