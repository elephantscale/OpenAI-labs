Zevachim 5 - Why is an Erroneous Sacrifice Valid? Said Resh Lakish, "We know that if one brings a sacrifice for the sake of a different one, it is valid, but is not counted toward the owner's obligation. But that is not logical! If the 'for the sake of' requirement is important, the sacrifice should be altogether invalid. And if it is not that important, it should count toward the owner's obligation!"
