Sanhedrin 65 - Molech, Ov, Yidoni One who gives of his offspring to Molech is not liable to stoning unless he hands the child over to Molech and passes him through the fire. The child would remain alive, being either passed between two walls of fire, or the parent would jump with him over a fiery pit. There were other forms of worship, though, where the child was actually burned.
