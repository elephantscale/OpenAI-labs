 If one violated a commandment, resulting in a guilt-offering, and furthermore if he is in doubt about this, both an and a leader of the community bring a "doubtful guilt-offering," but the anointed priest and the court are exempt. Regarding a definite guilt-offering, an individual, the leader, and the priest are liable, but the court is exempt.
