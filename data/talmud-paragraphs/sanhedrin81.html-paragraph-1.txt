 One who has been flogged twice by the court - the court places him in a cell and there they feed him barley until his stomach bursts. How could that be? Here we are dealing with one who repeated the same transgression twice, provided that this transgression carries the penalty of excision from Heaven. Since he demonstrated that he wants to die, the court just speeds up his death. However, if he transgressed multiple prohibitions, but each of them only once - he is just tasting various prohibitions.
