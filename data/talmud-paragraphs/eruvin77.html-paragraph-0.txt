Eruvin 77 - Wall If there is a wall between two courtyards, and this wall is at least ten hand-breadths high and four hand-breadths thick and, unlike the previous case, there is no window in that wall, then the residents of each of the two courtyards are considered separate from each other, and each courtyard should make an individual eruv (common food) so that they can each carry within their own courtyard.
