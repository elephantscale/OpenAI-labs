Gittin 21 - What to write the Get on? Can one write a Get on a big leaf growing on a tree, then tear it off and give it to his wife? - No! Since the Torah said, "And he will write for her a letter of divorce and give it," we understand that he must be able to give the Get immediately after writing. Here we have another action, tearing off, intervene between writing the Get and giving it, and therefore such Get is invalid. If he did, however, write on a leaf, tore it off and gave it to his wife, he did not do things correctly, but the divorce is valid.
