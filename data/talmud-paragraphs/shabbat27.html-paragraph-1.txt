 Since the Torah did not just say "garment" but "and the garment", we see that even a piece of three by three finger-breadths is included. But maybe the Torah meant a larger piece of clothing, three by three hand-breadths, which has some use for everybody, rich and poor? - No, that the Torah did not have to include, because it already included the warp and the woof, in that they can become impure: if such small unfinished piece is susceptible to impurity, then how much more so a finished piece of three by three hand-breadths!
