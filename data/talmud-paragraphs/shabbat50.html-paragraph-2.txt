 Ameimar, mar Zutra and Rav Ashi were sitting together one Shabbat, and they brought them "barda," a mix of aloe, myrtle, and violets. Ameimar and Rav Ashi washed their faces and hands with it, but Mar Zutra did not. They asked him, "Are you afraid that you will accidentally remove some hair from your skin on Shabbat, through the use of aloe? - But the law is like Rabbi Shimon, that it is permitted, since the hair is removed only accidentally!" However, his reason was different - a man should not beautify himself as a woman does. Then what was their reason? - Just the opposite, one should clean and beautify himself, since this brings glory to God. In fact, one must say a blessing on a seeing handsome creature.
