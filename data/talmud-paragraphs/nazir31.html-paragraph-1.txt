 Beit Shammai says that, indeed, it will. Why? Because Beit Shammai claims that even done by mistake, consecrations are still valid. One cannot undo a consecration to the Temple if done by mistake. Another explanation is that he really made no mistake. He planned for the first ox to become sacred. To emphasize, he specified that it would be black (as this was more valuable to him). But even if a white one comes out first - it will become sacred, and the color does not matter.
