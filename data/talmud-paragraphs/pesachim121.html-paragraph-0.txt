Pesachim 121 - Two blessings The Passover offering must be eaten "in the manner of kings." Just as kings are never truly hungry, so one must eat it when he is more or less full. To fulfill this, there was another sacrifice at the Passover meal, called "holiday offering." One ate this first and only then proceeded to the Passover lamb.
