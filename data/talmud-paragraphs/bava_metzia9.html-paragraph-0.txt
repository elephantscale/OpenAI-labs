Bava Metzia 9 - Rider Sees a Find If someone was riding on an animal and he sighted a find, an ownerless article, and he said to his fellow, who was standing nearby, "Give it to me," and that other person took it and then said "I have acquired it for myself," - he has indeed acquired it for himself. It is implied that he had it in mind when he picked it up, not that he changed his mind later.
