Sanhedrin 111 - Does One Have to Fulfill the Entire Torah? The Ten Tribes are not destined to ever return from their place of exile, because God "cast them to another land, as this very day." Just as the day goes, never to return, so the Ten Tribes go, never to return - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer, however, says that the phrase "as this very day" implies that just as the day darkens and then becomes light, so too the Ten Tribes, for whom it is dark, will likewise one day have light. Said Rabbi Yochanan, "Rabbi Akiva has abandoned his usual generosity of spirit."
