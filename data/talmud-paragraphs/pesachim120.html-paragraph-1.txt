 Today there is no Passover offering, and eating matzah takes its place. Can one eat a dessert after that? Some say that since the taste of the matzah is weak, any dessert will overpower it, so any dessert is prohibited. Others, however, read the above rule differently: "No dessert is served after the Passover offering" - only after the offering can you not serve dessert, but after the matzah, you can.
