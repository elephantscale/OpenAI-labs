 Seeing that they had favor with God, they asked to destroy the desire for forbidden relations. When this was granted, the world stopped functioning and they could not even find a fresh egg for a sick person.

Understanding that they would not be granted to remove the desire only for forbidden relations, they were at least able to abolish the urge for one's relatives.
