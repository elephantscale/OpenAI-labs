 Why is this mentioned here? Because it seems to answer who is right in the previous question of feeding one who does not have what to eat - there Rabbi Yose did not allow the circumvent a vow by declaring the food ownerless. If at least after three days, one cannot retract, then such declarations are to be taken seriously, and the food in question is really ownerless and not subject to a vow, and the hungry person can eat it - despite what Rabbi Yose said.
