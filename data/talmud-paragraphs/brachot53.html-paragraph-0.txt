Brachot 53 - Where to say the after-meal prayer After Shabbat ends, one recites the Havdallah - the separation between Shabbat and a weekday. Here Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel argue whether one should say "Who creates illuminations of the fire" or "illumination of the fire." Incidentally, one should say the blessing on the fire, but not one used for idolatrous purposes, not one lighted for prohibited work during Shabbat, and not one lighted in honor of someone. It should be fire started to give light - since he did not light any fire on Shabbat, and to commemorate Adam, who discovered fire after Shabbat.
