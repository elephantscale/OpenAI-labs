 At which exact moment is the law of misappropriation removed? Bar Kappara said to Bar Padda, "Please ask about the moment of permissibility in the study hall tomorrow, and be ready to discuss the question. Did Rabbi Yehoshuah mean the moment of slaughter, the moment of throwing the blood, or the moment when it can be eaten?" On the next day, Chizkiyah said that it was the moment of slaughter, and Rabbi Yochanan said that it was the moment of eating. In discussing this, the Talmud has to modify its understanding of many rules, and the discussion itself continued through the ages.
