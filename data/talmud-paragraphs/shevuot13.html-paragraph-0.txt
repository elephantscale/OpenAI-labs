Shevuot 13 - Eating and Working on Yom Kippur The goat sacrifice, whose blood is brought inside the Holy of Holies, atones all transgressions related to ritual purity, whether performed by mistake or deliberately. The goat sent away atones for all sins, whether done by mistake or deliberately - provided that the person repents. Greater than this is the day of Yom Kippur itself, which atones for all transgressions between man and God, again, provided that the man repents.
