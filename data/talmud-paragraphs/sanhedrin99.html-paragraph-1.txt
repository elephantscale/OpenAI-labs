 The books of Prophets contain many descriptions of the utopian idyllic state of life. All these refer only to the Messianic Era, but the reward of the World to Come is beyond human comprehension, and "No eye except Yours, O God, has seen that which He will do for one who awaits Him" - this is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan. However, Shmuel says that there will be no difference between this world and the Messianic Era, except that the Jews will be completely free from foreign dominion.
