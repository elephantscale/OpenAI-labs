 Rabbi Akiba agrees that the liquid measures and their overbrim is sacred, but he argues about the dry ones and says that even the inside of the measure was not sanctified. Rabbi Yose says that the law of the overbrim is explained thus: liquids mix, and liquid top is as if it came from the inside, but dry measures do not mix.
