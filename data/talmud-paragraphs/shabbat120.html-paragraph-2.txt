 Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas tells us the rule that one may cover a carriage, trunk, or closet in which fire has taken hold, and cover it with a hide - since hide singes but does not burn. One may also surround the fire with clay jugs filled with water, and if they burst and extinguish the fire - so be it. However, this last ruling is a problem, since it seems to violate even the lenient of opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who permits unintended benefit on Shabbat.
