 However, the Shema is not said when one actually goes to sleep or wakes up, but rather in the general period when people lie down and get up. When is this? In the evening - when the Kohanim, who were impure, are returning from the mikveh to eat priestly portion (terumah), that is, at nightfall. That is when the time to say the Shema in the evening begins, but when does it end? Rabbi Eliezer said, "Until the end of the first watch, that is, the first part of the night." Rabbi Eliezer understands "when you lie down" as the time when people go to sleep. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. We can understand Rabban Gamliel, 'when people lie down" means when people are asleep. But the opinion of the Sages will require clarification.
