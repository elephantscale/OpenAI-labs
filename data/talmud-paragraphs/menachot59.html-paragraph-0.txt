Menachot 59 - No Oil and No Frankincense Some flour offerings require both oil and frankincense, some - only one of these, and some - neither oil nor frankincense. Normally, one mixes in oil and puts frankincense on top of the offering. This includes all fine-flour offerings brought as free-will offerings, those cooked on a griddle, in a pan, loaves, wafers, the daily offering of a High Priest, and the offering of a non-Jew.
