 Furthermore, the Cutheans considered a woman a niddah when she had blood of any color, not just any of the four colors we learned above. They thought this to be an additional stringency. However, that really was a leniency: if their woman saw, for example, yellow color of blood, she would start counting her seven days - which was wrong. If she then saw red blood, it would be included in the seven-day count, which would thus finish earlier than it should. Thus, she would immerse while still a niddah, and the immersion would be infective.
