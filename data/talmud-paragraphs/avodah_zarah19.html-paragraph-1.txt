 "...and he shall be like a tree rooted by a stream of waters..." teaches that one should not learn from a single teacher, but uproot himself and go to another. Rav Chisda taught this to his students, and they all left him and went to Rabbah. Rabbah told them, "This dictum only applies to learning logic, but the body of knowledge is better acquired from one teacher, in one style" - and they all came back to Rav Chisda.
