 If, while slaughtering the sacrifice, one has a wrong intent about eating, and plans to eat in the wrong place or after allotted time - but what he plans to eat is not usually edible, such as the hide, or is not really the meat of the sacrifice, such as the gravy, or he plans to eat less than an olive's volume - the sacrifice remains valid.
