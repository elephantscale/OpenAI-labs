 Can one unfasten the tzitzit on one garment and put it on another one? Rav says "no," but Shmuel says "yes," and this is one of the cases where Shmuel wins. We can even put the new tzitzit on the garment which already has the old ones, and this does not contradict the rule of "make but do not use already made ones" above, since in this case the removal of the old tzitzit is part of the making of the new ones.
