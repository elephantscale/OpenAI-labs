 However, Rav Mesharshya said that these rules are not true. That is strange: these rules are so well established that hardly anybody argues with them. The Talmud goes through multiple example, trying to agree with Rav Mesharshya. For example, to change one's residence area for Shabbat (techum), a poor man can walk to the new place on Friday evening and stay their until night, and a rich man can put his food there, even through a messenger. Rabbi Meir says that these laws are for the benefits of the poor, who alone is allowed to do in the first one, but Rabbi Yehudah says that they are a leniency for the rich. On that, Rav said "The law follows Rabbi Yehudah."
