Shabbat 85 - Seeds in a garden patch Another one in the list of allusions and implications is drawn from the phrase in Isaiah, "Like the earth gives forth its plant, and like a garden causes its seeds to sprout..." The prophet describes the salvation of the Jewish people which will blossom gloriously at the end of days, but he also hints to the laws of planting. In general, it is forbidden to plant different species together, and here we can derive that on a garden patch of six by six hand-breadths one can plant five types of seeds but no more. How do we know that?
