Makkot 8 - Negligent, Inadvertent , and Grossly Negligent Killing A negligent killer runs away to one of the cities of refuge, where he lives in exile until the death of the High Priest. In the city he is safe, but once outside, the avenger of blood - a close relative of the victim - is allowed to kill him. If the killing was a complete accident, the killer is not punishable at all, but if it was gross negligence, then the city of refuge does not protect him.
