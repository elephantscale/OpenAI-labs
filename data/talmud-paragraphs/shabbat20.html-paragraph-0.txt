Shabbat 20 - Lighting Shabbat Candles One has to enjoy Shabbat and honor it. As the first step, one lights a lamp, in order to conduct the Shabbat meal in a lighted room. Some say that the lamp is for enjoyment, since it is impossible to completely enjoy a meal in a dark house; others say that that the lamp or candles are to honor Shabbat.
