 A scribe may write a Get for a man even if his wife is not with him. In the eleventh century Rabbeinu Gershom instituted a ban against divorcing one's wife against her will. He may also write a receipt for a woman, stating that she received her Ketubah, even if her husband is not with her, and the husband pays the fee.
