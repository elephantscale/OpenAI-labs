 Rava permitted a few things on the holiday weekday, depending on one's intentions. For example, suppose one is leveling the mounds of rocks and earth in his field. In that case, if he is doing it to prepare a threshing floor - it is permitted (because it is for a festival need). Still, it is forbidden if he is doing it to prepare for cultivation (and he won't enjoy the fruit of his labor this holiday). How do we know what he has in mind? By the size of the mound that he leaves over.
