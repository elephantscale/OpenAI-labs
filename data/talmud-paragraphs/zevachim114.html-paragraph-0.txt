Zevachim 114 - Temporarily Blemished Sacrifices Brought Outside If a sacrifice has a permanent blemish, then it cannot be brought "before God," and therefore everybody agrees that one who sacrifices it outside the Temple is not liable. However, if one sacrifices an animal with a temporarily blemish, then Rabbi Shimon says that he violates a negative commandment and is liable to lashes, but the Sages consider him completely exempt.
