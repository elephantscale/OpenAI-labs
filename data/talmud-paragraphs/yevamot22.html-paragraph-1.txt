 What did the teacher mean by "any child?" He could have said it shorter, "A child." - Even a mamzer - a son born from a woman married to another. But how do we know that? Maybe the Torah discusses only a legitimate son? - From the words "And he has no son," - "U ben ein lo." The term "ein" can be understood as "ain," which would mean an eye, telling us to look into the matter and discover any existing son. For example, if he has a daughter, she also exempts her mother from yibum. The exception to this case is a child born from a slave or a non-Jewish woman, who is not considered the man's offspring for the purposes of Jewish law.
