 Rav Chisda did so, and Nechemyah came back. But how were they allowed to create a human fence? After all, they are creating a partition and a private area on Shabbat!? - Rav Chisda called them, but he did not tell them why he called them, so they were not consciously doing it. But how were they allowed to walk beyond the techum? - They all have made an eruv in a different place, so they were allowed to walk farther than Nechemya. But still, people might misunderstand this law and do it voluntarily next time? - That is true, and such a ruse is only allowed for a scholar like Nechemyah.
