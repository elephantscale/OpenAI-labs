 When the two rulers, descendants of the Maccabeans, fought, one of them besieged Jerusalem. Those inside kept bringing sacrifices which they bought from the assailants. One old man in Jerusalem transmitted to the assailants through signs that the sacrifices shielded Jerusalem, and the next time when they lowered the basket with money, back came a pig. It stuck its hooves into the wall of Jerusalem, and the whole Land of Israel shook. It was at this time that they could not find any barley, but one mute man came and put one hand on a roof (gag) and another on a hut (tzerif). Mordechai was there and said, "Is there a place called Gagot Tzerifin or Tzerifin Gagot?" They searched and found barley there.
