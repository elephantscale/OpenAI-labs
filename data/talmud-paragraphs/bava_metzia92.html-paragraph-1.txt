 A worker may eat a cucumber (cucumbers were expensive vegetables) or a date (which were expensive fruit) even if worth a dinar (six times his wage). The Torah tells the worker "...you may eat grapes as is your desire, to your satiety..." which implies that he may eat any amount needed to satisfy his hunger.
