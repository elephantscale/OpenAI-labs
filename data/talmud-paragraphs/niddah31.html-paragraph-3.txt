 A lamp is lit for an unborn child in its mother's womb, and he peers and sees from one end of the world to the other. They teach him the entire Torah, but as soon as the child emerges into the world, an angel comes and strikes him on the upper lip, causing him to forget it all. However, the child cannot be born until he gives an oath. They tell him to promise, "Be a good person, and don't be a bad person. However, even if the whole world tells you that you are righteous, view yourself as having achieved nothing at all."
