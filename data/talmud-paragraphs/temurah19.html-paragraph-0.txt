Temurah 19 - Descendants Of A Male Burned Offering A burned offering can be only a male, and therefore there is no question of the law for its descendants. However, its exchange can be considered its descendant, in some sense. Additionally, if one exchanges it for a female animal, that female can in turn have descendants. All of these "descendants," and their descendants, ad infinitum, are brought as burned offerings, with all their laws.
