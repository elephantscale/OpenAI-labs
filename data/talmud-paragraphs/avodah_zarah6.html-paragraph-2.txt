 So the idolaters took the law of sacrifices to God and applied it to sacrifices to their idols, and are careful that the animal should be intact. What is the source for this law? - Noah was commanded to take whole animals into the Ark, because he would bring some as a sacrifice. But maybe they were not whole? - The Torah says, "With you," meaning, "Like you." But maybe Noah himself was not whole? - That can't be, because then only lame animals would be allowed.
