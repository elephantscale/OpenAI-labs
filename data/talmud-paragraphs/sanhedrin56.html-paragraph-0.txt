Sanhedrin 56 - The Blasphemer The blasphemer is one who "blesses", (that is, curses) the Divine Name of God. The act of blasphemy is always referred to in the Talmud by the euphemism, "blessing." The blasphemer is not liable unless he pronounces the Divine Name, yud, keh, vav, keh. In referring to the Tetragrammaton name of God, it is accepted practice to modify the spelling and to pronounce the letter "heh" as "keh".
