 If a handful became mixed with another flour offering, from which a handful has not been taken yet, then nothing can be done about it. One cannot burn the mixture because of the flour of the other offering mixed it, since only the handful can be burned. Neither can one take two handfuls. If the kohen went ahead and burned it on the Altar anyway, it counts for the owner of the first offering, but not for the owner of the second offering, into which the handful fell.
