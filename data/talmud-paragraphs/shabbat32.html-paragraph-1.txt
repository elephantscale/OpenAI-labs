 In general, one goes through life unimpeded, but his merits are weighted in the time of danger. For a man this means going over a shaky bridge, or any similar dangerous circumstance. As an illustration, Rav would not pass over a bridge on which an idolater was sitting - Rav felt that his merits might be insufficient to save him, if the judgment was visited on the idolater. Shmuel, on the other hand, would not pass a bridge where an idolater was not sitting - his reasoning was that either idolater has bad luck or Shmuel, but not both at once. Rabbi Yannai would check a boat for leaks and then cross. His logic was that one should not rely on miracles. If he is then saved from danger, it looks as if it happened due to natural causes, and even if a miracle is performed, this is undesirable, because it deducts from his account of good deeds.
