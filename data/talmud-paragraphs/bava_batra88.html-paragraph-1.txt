 A wholesaler must wipe his measures clean once in thirty days, and a householder, once in twelve months. This law applies to measures that are used for liquids which leave a residue, such as wine or oil. Since the residue tends to settle in the measure and congeal, the measure must be cleaned periodically. Since a wholesaler sells frequently, his measure tends to gather residue more quickly.
