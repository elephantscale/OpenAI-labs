 In fact, according to Rabbi Shimon, the prohibition of "it and its offspring" does not apply to sacrifices at all. Rav Hamnuna said, this is because after slaughter the meat is not ready to be eaten until its blood is thrown on the Altar, and thus it is not a shechitah. Rava said that this is because perhaps they will not throw the blood on the Altar. Then the warning they can give him becomes doubtful at best, and one is not liable for transgressing a law without a clear unequivocal warning immediately prior to the act.
