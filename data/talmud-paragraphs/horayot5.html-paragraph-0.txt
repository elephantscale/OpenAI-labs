Horayot 5 - Who Brings the Bull for the "Sin of Forgetfulness" If one of the court members realized that they have erred and dissented, or if the most distinguished member of the court was not present, or if one of the judges was disqualified for the court, such as a convert or an elder who is unfit to father children - they don't bring a bull offering. If the court ruled incorrectly on purpose, and not by mistake, then each individual who transgressed brings his own sin offering, an ewe or a she-goat.
