Sukkah 37 - Tying it all together It is good to tie the bunch of Sukkot branches together. Rabbi Yehudah even considers this a necessary requirement: the branches must be bound together. Thus, the material that you use to tie it together is part of the mitzvah. If so, it must be one of the same four species that you are tying - otherwise, you are adding to a mitzvah and taking together five species, and not four, and the Torah said, "Do not add to the mitzvot or subtract from them."
