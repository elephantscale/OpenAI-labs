Sanhedrin 61 - Intention to Worship Idols Rav Hamnuna lost several oxen and went to search for them. Rabbah met him and asked a question: we have learned that one who serves an idol is subject to stoning. This implies that one has to actually serve the idol to be liable. But in regard to a subverted city, we have learned that if one says, "I will serve," or "I will go and serve," or "Let us go and serve" a certain idol, he is already liable. So is action required or is professed intention sufficient?
