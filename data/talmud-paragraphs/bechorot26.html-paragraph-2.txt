 How did the Sages arrive at these specific care-periods? The Torah said, "Your first fruit you shall not delay... so you shall do to your ox," and this additional "do" was understood as an extra twenty days. The Torah was intentionally vague about the limits in the first place, giving the Sages a "blank check" to fill in the amounts, and they compared firstborn to first fruit. Rabbi Yose says that the Sages estimated the time that an animal is dependent on its mother.
