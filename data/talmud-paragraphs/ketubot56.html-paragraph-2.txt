 What is the logic of the two opinions? Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah is very clear: a man does not want to give everything away before he has actually enjoyed the benefits of his bride becoming his wife. So we understand his intent. However, the other opinion also guesses his intent differently: why did he add that amount to the 200 zuz? - So that the bride will be suitably disposed toward him and agree to be his wife. This has already been achieved, and therefore he owes the total amount.
