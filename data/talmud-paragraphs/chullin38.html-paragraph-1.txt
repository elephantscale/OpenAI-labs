 No! That's can't be, because the Torah also said, "Do not eat nevelah, an animal that died by itself" which means that all the time that it is alive, you may slaughter and eat it. But perhaps nevelah and close to death are the same thing!? Rather, since Ezekiel said in his prayer "I never ate terefah or nevelah," we understand that he never ate the meat of an animal that was close to death, though normally this is allowed - for otherwise, what would be his special praise?
