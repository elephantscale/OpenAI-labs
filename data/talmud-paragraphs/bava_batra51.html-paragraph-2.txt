 The best way to sell the field to one's wife is to write both terms in the contract, "the field is sold to you" and "the field is given to you." The sale term will help her if the field is repossessed by the husband's lenders - by giving her the right to be reimbursed by the husband. The term "given" will help against a neighbor's right to buy an adjoining field.
