Pesachim 53 - Customs not to follow A while ago, there was a custom not to sell large livestock to gentiles for the following reason. One may sell an ox or a horse just before Shabbat, the buyer may then ask to demonstrate the animal's prowess, and the Jew would spur it on with his voice, thus causing the animal to work on Shabbat. (This prohibition is not in force today).
