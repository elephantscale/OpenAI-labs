 However, this logic is flawed. There is a stringency with the young goat and its mother: they cannot be killed on one day. This stringency is not found in regards to the goat kid and a cow who is a complete stranger to him. Thus, with our logic disproved, we need another way to derive the prohibition - and it is derived from the second repetition of "don't cook a young goat in its mother milk," which, his mother being already prohibited, now teaches us the same law about a cow.
