 If one does decide to make a vow, he has a choice of many words to use, "konam," "konach," "konas." These were created by the Sages so that one should not use the word "korban" (sacrifice). But why not use the word "korban?" - Because he may say, "Korban to God." But let him say that! - Because he may say just "To God," thus using the name of God for no purpose. This all is the view of Resh Lakish.
