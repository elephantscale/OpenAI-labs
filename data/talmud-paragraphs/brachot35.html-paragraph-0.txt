Brachot 35 - Why say a blessing? Before eating the fruits of the tree, one must say "Blessed is the One Who creates the fruit of the tree." Why? - In describing the fourth year of a tree, the Torah said "Holy for praises to God." We thus see that one must say two praises to God, before food and after. But this phrase is used to teach the basic law of the fourth year!? True, so we can learn only one blessing from this phrase, said after eating, and derive the other one through logic: if he blesses when he is satisfied, surely he must bless when he is hungry!
