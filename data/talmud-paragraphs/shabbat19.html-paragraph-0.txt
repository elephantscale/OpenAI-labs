Shabbat 19 - Lest he stokes the coals Although Beit Hillel have no problem allowing the vessels to work on Shabbat - barring such cases as loud mills - they do prohibit putting a pot into an oven just prior to sundown. Why? - Because in his desire to eat the meal, one can stoke the fire. It follows from here that if the food in the pot is completely raw, then it is allowed to put it into the oven. And why is that? - Since one has no hope of eating it on Friday night anyway, one will not come to stoke the fire.
