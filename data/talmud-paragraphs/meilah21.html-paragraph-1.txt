 If one sends an agent to a store, unintentionally giving him money of the Temple, but then recalls that it was consecrated money, then, to spare the store-owner the unwitting transgression, he should take his own perutah (small coin) and say, "The perutah of the Temple, wherever it maybe is hereby deconsecrated on upon this perutah."
