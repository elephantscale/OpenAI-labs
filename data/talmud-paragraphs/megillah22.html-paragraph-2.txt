 Everyone who reads in the Torah should be given at least three phrases. This presents another problem: since the Torah is written in small sections, visually delineated from the rest, they should read at least three phrases from the beginning of each section. Otherwise, those going in might mistakenly conclude that the previous reader got only two phrases. The same applies to the end of the portion. Therefore, how does one divide the section consisting of five phrases? - He reads three from the beginning, and the next reader repeats the last phrase; thus, both read three phrases. Some say that these precautions only apply to people who are going out. Anyone coming in will surely ask, "How come we started two phrases from the beginning? Did the previous reader only get two phrases?" - and they will explain to him that the reader started from the section before.
