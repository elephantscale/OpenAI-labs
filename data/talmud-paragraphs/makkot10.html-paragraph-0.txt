Makkot 10 - Arrangements for the Unintentional Killer The phrase "and he shall flee to one of those cities and live" teaches that we have to provide him with arrangements that will enable him to live. If he is a student of Torah, we exile his teacher with him, because a student cannot survive without the one who teaches him Torah. From here we see that a person should not teach a disciple who is not of good character. Furthermore, if the teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him.
