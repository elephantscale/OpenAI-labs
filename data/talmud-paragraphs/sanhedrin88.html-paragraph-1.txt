 With regard to rebellious sage, greater stringency is attached to the teachings of the Sages, like the ones found in the Talmud, than to the words of the Torah. If, for example, he says that there is no commandment of tefillin, he is exempt, since it is such an obvious distortion that it cannot be viewed as a ruling. However, if he says that there are five compartments in the tefillin, and not four, he is liable.
