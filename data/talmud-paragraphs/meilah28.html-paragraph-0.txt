Meilah 28 - Temple at the Break of Dawn (Tamid) After settling the question of who would be doing the first service, separating the ashes, the appointed Kohen would take a key and open a small door that led from the Hall of Fire into the Courtyard. The main door would be opened later on in the day. Two groups of Kohanim followed him, and each carried a torch. Once in the Courtyard, one group walked in the east colonnade and one in the west, checking the vessels as they walked. If all the vessels were in order, they said, "Peace, all is well."
