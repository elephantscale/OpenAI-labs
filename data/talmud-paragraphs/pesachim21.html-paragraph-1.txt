 As long as it is permitted to eat chametz, one may feed it to domestic animals, beasts in the field, and birds, sell it to a non-Jew, and generally benefit from it. Once the time has passed, all benefit from chametz is forbidden, even lighting up a fire to warm oneself or burning it in an oven to cook.
