Kiddushin 78 - Parents Testify About Children If a Kohen cohabits with his sister, he renders her a zonah (someone who engaged in illicit relationship that is forbidden to her), but he does not render her a chalalah (someone whose child looses Kohanic sanctity). However, if he cohabits with her again, he renders her a chalalah.
