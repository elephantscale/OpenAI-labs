 So how long is that? Rabbi Ishmael said, "The time it takes to mix a cup of wine." Rabbi Yehoshuah said, "Time to drink it." Ben Azai said, "Time to fry an egg." Rabbi Akiva: "Time to swallow that egg." Chanin ben Pinchas said, "The time it takes her to put a hand into a basket and take out a bread." The Talmud discusses these and other opinions and changes them; for example, "Time to drink" really means "Time to mix and then drink." It also wants to know what kind of bread, wheat or barley, warm or cold, and what type of basket, but does not find an answer.
