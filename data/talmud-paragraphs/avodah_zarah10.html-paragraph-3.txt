 Antoninus was upset, but Rabbi Yehudah told Antoninus, "It is not a man, but an angel." To verify this, Antoninus told Rabbi Chanina, "Go and wake my servant, sleeping at the door." Rabbi Chanina found the servant dead. Not wanting to either come back with the bad news, or to flee, Rabbi Chanina revived the servant. Antoninus said, "I know that the least among you can resurrect the dead, but please next time nobody should be with you."
