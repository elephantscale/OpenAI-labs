 Another Friday night precaution: one should not delouse his garment or read a book, using a oil lamp, lest he strain to see something and adjust the light. On Shabbat during the day, how is one to delouse his garment? One should roll the flee between his fingers and throw it away, but not kill it. Nor should one do this in the street, out of respect for the passer-byes. Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha thought that he could read by lamp light, and almost came to tilt the lamp. Some say, he did tilt it, and later wrote a note, "When the Temple is rebuilt, I will bring a fine sacrifice for my violation."
