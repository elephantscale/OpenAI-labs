 Abba Shaul said, "They adopted this practice also in the provinces, except that they used the time for frivolities." Elijah the Prophet met Rav Yehudah and told him, "You ask why the Messiah is not here yet? It is Yom Kippur, yet how many virgins lost their virginity this night in Nehardea!" Rav Yehudah asked, "And what does God say about it?" Elijah answered, "Sin waits at the door (that is, I, God, created the desire for illicit relations.)." Rav Yehudah asked again, "And what does the Accuser say? Elijah told him, "Accuser has no say on Yom Kippur." The Gematria of Accuser (Satan) is 364, and on Yom Kippur, which is the day 365, he has no power."
