Moed Katan 19 - Seven and thirty Although it is permitted to write some documents on the holiday weekday, because without these documents one may suffer a loss, still there are documents that one is not allowed to write. For example, when one loans money to a friend for the needs of the Holiday, he should not require that the loan document is written. However, if he does not trust the borrower or the scribe is poor and needs the money, writing is allowed. Likewise, a scribe should not write tefillin or a Sefer Torah. Rabbi Yehudah allowed him to write tefillin for himself - and then change his mind and sell it. And Rabbi Yose says that the enjoyment of the Holiday is more important than refraining from work - therefore, he can write tefillin and sell it, as usual, to add to his festivities.
