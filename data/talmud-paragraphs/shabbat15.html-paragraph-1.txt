 When making dough, one has to separate a portion for a priest (Kohen) and give it to him. Nowadays, when the priests are no longer ritually pure, one separates and destroys a symbolic amount. How much dough is considered significant enough for separating the Kohen's portion, called challah? Shammai says that it is one kav (the volume of twenty-four eggs), while Hillel maintains that it is twice that amount, or two kavim. Both base their measurements on the amount of manna that the Jews would have for their meal in the desert, except that Shammai says that one meal forms this basis, and Hillel - that daily amount of manna, collected in the morning and then used for the two meals of the day, should be used in the calculation.
