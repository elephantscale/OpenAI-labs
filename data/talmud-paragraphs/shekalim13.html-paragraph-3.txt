 And what is the story of this she-donkey? It was stolen by robbers but refused to eat stolen food. After three days, the robbers let it go, and it came back but still refused to eat. Rabbi Pinchas asked the inn-keeper, have you separated the tithes? The inn-keeper answered that the animals were not obligated to keep doubtful tithes' laws (d'mai). To that, Rabbi Pinchas answered that this was true, but she was very stringent with herself and accepted not to eat even doubtfully untithed produce. They gave her properly tithed food, and she ate.
