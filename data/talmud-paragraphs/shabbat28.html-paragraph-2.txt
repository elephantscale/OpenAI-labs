 The law of the wooden roof not accepting ritual impurity of the dead - although it transmits this impurity to other objects - is derived from the laws of the covering of the Tabernacle. A related question is the skin of an animal called "tachash," also translated as "blue processed skin" - was it a kosher animal or not. It had one horn, and therefore should have been kosher, since we learned in the tractate Niddah that this is a sign of a kosher animal. Besides, the ox that Adam brought as a sacrifice, also had one horn, and it definitely was kosher. However, it could be that the unicorn called tachash was a special creature that appeared just once, to provide skins for the Tabernacle (it was multicolored, " joyous in his colors" in Aramaic), but then was hidden again, and its kosher status remains in doubt.
