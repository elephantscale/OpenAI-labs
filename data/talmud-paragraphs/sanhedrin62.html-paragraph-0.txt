Sanhedrin 62- Multiple Acts of Service in One Period of Unawareness Rabbi Zakkai taught the following in the academy of Rabbi Yochanan: "If one slaughtered an offering, burnt an offering, poured a libation and bowed down to an idol, and he did all of these acts unintentionally in one period of unawareness, without realizing between the acts that he had committed a transgression, he is liable to bring only one sin offering." Said Rabbi Yochanan to him, "Leave my study hall and teach this ruling outside; it is incorrect."
