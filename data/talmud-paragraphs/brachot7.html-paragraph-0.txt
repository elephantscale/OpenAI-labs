Brachot 7 - God Prays How do we know that the Holy One Blessed is He, prays? - From Isaiah, "I will make them rejoice in the House of My prayer" - and not "their prayer," which tells us that the Holy One Blessed is He prays. What is His prayer? "May it be My will that My mercy conquer My anger... and I will go beyond the boundary of judgment with My children." Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha, a High Priest, told that once on Yom Kippur he entered the Holy of Holies to burn incense and saw Achteriel God of Legions sitting on His throne, and God told him, "Ishmael, My son, bless Me." He blessed God with "May it be Your will that Your mercy will conquer Your anger..." and saw God nod, demonstrating His approval. From here we saw that even a blessing of an ordinary person should not be unimportant in your eyes.
