Avodah Zarah 46 - Bowing Down to an Egg Stood on One End If stones were dislodged from a mountain and were then worshipped - some say that they are prohibited for benefit, but some say that they are permitted. The reason for them to be permitted is that they are analogous to a mountain. Just as a mountain which has not been affected by the hand of man remains permitted, so too the stones. The reason for them to be prohibited is that the phrase "You shall surely loathe it" denies the above analogy.
