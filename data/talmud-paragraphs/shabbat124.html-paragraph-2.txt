 If a utensil broke on Shabbat, its pieces can be used, but only if the remaining piece can be put for some use. For example, fragments of a mixing bowl can be used to form an improvised cover for a jug. Rabbi Yehudah limits it further: this use should be similar to that of the complete utensil, for example, fragments of glass can be used only if you can pour oil in them.
