 Rabbi Shimon Shezuri made a statement: the calf of a slaughtered cow, even when it is five years old and is plowing in the field, is still permitted through the shechitah of its mother and may be killed in any way and eaten. But we've been saying this all along!? - Actually, the Sages have prohibited this as soon its feet touch the ground, and have put the requirement of a regular shechitah back, because otherwise people watching it may decide that shechitah is never required. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says that the Sages made no such decree.
