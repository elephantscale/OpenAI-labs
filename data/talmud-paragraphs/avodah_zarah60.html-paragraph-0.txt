Avodah Zarah 60 - Idolater Who Fell Into Wine If an idolater was found standing beside a Jew's wine cistern, then he may have touched the wine. On the other hand, he knows that by touching the wine he will ruin it for the Jew and may have to pay. Therefore, normally it can be assumed that he did not touch the wine, out of fear of being discovered. However, if he has a loan for that wine against the Jew, he can always justify his touching it, and in that case the wine is prohibited for benefit, because of this possibility.
