Eruvin 85 - To whom is the area? When two courtyards make an eruv (common food) for themselves but forget to make a joint one, on Shabbat they can carry in each courtyard but not between the courtyards. If there is a mound of earth, which extends both courtyards, to whom does it belong? Obviously, it is the same case as a window between two courtyards. If the mound is high, it is obviously the same case as a wall between courtyards.
