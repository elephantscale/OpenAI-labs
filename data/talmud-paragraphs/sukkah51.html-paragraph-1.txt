 Down from the Temple Courtyard, separated from it by fifteen steps, was the Women's Courtyard. The women sat and watched from the second tier while the priests and the Levites prepared the illumination. They had a large golden candelabra with four golden bowls on each branch. The total amount of oil used amounted to 120 log measures or about 15 gallons. The wicks were made from the worn-out belts of the priestly garments. There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated from this light.
