Kiddushin 34 - Women's Obligations to do Mitzvot Women are not obligated to do mitzvot which are related to time, such as dwelling in a succah or hearing the shofar, although they observe these as a custom. They are also not obligated to learn those areas of the Torah which have no practical applicability nowadays.
