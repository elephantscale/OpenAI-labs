Sanhedrin 85 - Striking and Cursing a Parent, Selling a Kidnapped into Slavery One who strikes his father or mother is not liable to execution unless he wounds them. Cursing a parent is more stringent than striking him, since one who curses his parent after the parent's death is liable to execution, but one who strikes his parent after the parent's death is exempt.
