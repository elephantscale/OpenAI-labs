 The lender then said to the third party, "If I don't pay the balance by such-and-such date, give the document to the lender" - meaning that he forfeits the partial payment. In the end he did not pay. Rabbi Yossi says that the third party should give the loan document to the lender. Rabbi Yehudah says that he should not give it back, because the borrower never really meant it.
