 Rav Dimi had a clarification for these rules, concerning libations. He said, "If I had someone to carry a letter go Babylon, I would write and send this clarification to them." But would he send it? The Torah said that "Write these words..." refers to the written Torah scroll, but "Through these words" refers to all other laws that one is not permitted to write down! - A new law is different, for it is better to violate the Torah prohibition of writing than risk whole Torah being forgotten.
