Yoma 49 - A mistake of Rav Sheshet They asked Rav Sheshet a question, "If a Kohen carries a part of a sacrifice in his left hand, is it valid or not?" He replied, "We should learn the answer from Yom Kippur: the High Priest carries the incense in his left hand, and the coals in his right, and that is OK!" Firstly, why does he have to bring such strong proof from Yom Kippur? - Because he wants to show that even in this serious case where atonement depends upon it, the service done with the left hand is still valid. But secondly, we learned an explicit ruling that any service done by a blemished Kohen while sitting or with the left hand is invalid! With this, Rav Sheshet's answer is completely disproved.
