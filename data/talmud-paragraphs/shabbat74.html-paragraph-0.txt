Shabbat 74 - What is selection? One of the labors forbidden on Shabbat is selection, such as selecting rocks from a heap of grain. Regarding it, we learned a cryptic rule: "If one had different foods in front of him, he may select and eat, and he may select and leave for others to eat, and he may not select, and if he did select, he needs to bring a sacrifice."
