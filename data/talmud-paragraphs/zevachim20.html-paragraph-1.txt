 Rav Assi could not understand the difference between this washing and the ten washings of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, which accompany his five changes of garments - since they do not invalidate the service. Rabbi Yochanan explained to him that the phrase "and then don them" tells us that the garments are essential, but washing is not. Rav Assi's face lit up. But his joy was premature, because Rabbi Yochanan then said, "and by the same token the morning washing should not be significant."
