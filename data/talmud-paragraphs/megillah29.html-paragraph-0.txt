Megillah 29 - When to close the books One should stop learning Torah to accompany a funeral procession or accompany a bride to the wedding. However, this is only when there are not enough people to honor the dead. And how many is enough? - Twelve thousand, just as the number of men who went to war with Midian. Others, however, say that it is six hundred thousand: just as the Torah was given to the soul in the presence of six hundred thousand people, it is taken away with six hundred thousand.
