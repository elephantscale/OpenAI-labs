Keritot 2 - Why Count Cases? There are thirty-six actions, for which one becomes liable to be cut off from his spiritual source. These include relations with one's mother, one's father's wife even if she is not his mother, one's sister, and one's daughter-in-law. They also include cohabiting with animals, with a woman who did not go to a mikva, eating bread on Passover, and violating Shabbat. As a rule, if one does it by mistake, he needs to bring a sin-offering, but if he does them on purpose, then he may be cut off.
