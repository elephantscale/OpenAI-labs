Pesachim 114 - Surprise the children The first cup of wine at the Seder is for Kiddush. First, he blesses the day and then the wine, since the day (Passover) is the whole reason for the Kiddush - these are the words of Beit Shammai. However, Beit Hillel school says that he blesses the wine first and then the day - since, without the wine, Kiddush cannot be said at all.
