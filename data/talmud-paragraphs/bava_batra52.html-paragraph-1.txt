 The chazakah, or presumption of ownership, discussed so far, had a challenge against it. For example, a case where a seller, that is, the previous owner claims "I did not sell the land," and the purchaser, that is, the occupant, claims, "I purchased it" - this is the chazakah of proving title, which requires three years to take effect.
