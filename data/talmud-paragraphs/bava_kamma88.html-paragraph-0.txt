Bava Kamma 88 - Payment for the Humiliation of a Canaanite Slave One who wounds a Canaanite slave of others is liable to all five categories of payment; Rabbi Yehudah says that "...a man and his brother..." excludes a slave from humiliation payment. And the Rabbis? The slave IS your brother in (some) commandments. Then can the slave testify in court? No, since the slave is similar to a woman and a minor, who also observe some commandments, yet can't testify in court.
