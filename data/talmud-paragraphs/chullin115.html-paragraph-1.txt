 Furthermore, from the teaching of Rabbi Abahu we learn not to derive benefit from such mixture. For Rabbi Abahu said, "Any time that the Torah commanded not to eat something, it is prohibited both for food and to derive benefit - unless the benefit was specifically allowed. For example, the Torah said, "Do not eat any animal that died by itself (nevelah), give to a Noahide or sell to a gentile." Had the Torah not mentioned specifically giving and selling, we would not be allowed to benefit from it - and this teaches us all such cases.
