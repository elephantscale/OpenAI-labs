Menachot 56 - Adding Blemish to a Blemish A firstborn animal must be given to a kohen. If it develops a permanent blemish, it belongs to the owner for consumption, but it is forbidden to make a blemish on purpose. If an animal is sick and the only remedy is to let blood, then there are four opinions on the permissibility of it. Rabbi Meir allows blood-letting, provided that this is done in a place where it does not cause a permanent blemish. The Sages allow to make a blemish, but not to slaughter based on it. Rabbi Shimon allows even to slaughter it, and Rabbi Yehudah absolutely forbids to led blood, even if the animal will die if left untreated.
