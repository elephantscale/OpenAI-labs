Sanhedrin 103 - Menasheh's Repentance Rabbi Yochanan said, "Whoever says that Menasheh has no portion in the World to Come weakens the resolve of potential penitents" - since Menasheh repented for the last thirty-three years of his life. To accept Menasheh's repentance, God made a secret tunnel in the firmament, to hide this from the Attribute of Justice.
