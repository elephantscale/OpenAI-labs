 Rav explains that the Torah laws of impurity do not apply to liquids. The Sages extended them to liquids for people to be more careful, but stopped short of making the liquids in the Temple impure because the Kohanim are careful anyway. Shmuel explains that on the contrary, the Torah laws of impurity do apply to liquids - but only to themselves, not to transmit impurity to others. The Sages extended the laws of impurity further, giving liquids the power to contaminate other foods, but stopped from accepting these laws in the Temple.
