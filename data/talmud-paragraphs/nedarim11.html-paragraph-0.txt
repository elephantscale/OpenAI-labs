Nedarim 11 - You are not kosher to me! One can use the language of "not kosher" to create a vow. For example, if one says, "It is not kosher what I eat of yours!" - he has, in fact, forbidden himself the food coming from his fellow, and it would be counted as if he violated the Torah if he did eat it.
