 Rabbi Yehudah disagrees and says that the sciatics sinew of a non-kosher animal is also forbidden - because it was prohibited since the time of Jacob, when non-kosher animals were still permitted. The Sages replied to Rabbi Yehudah, "The sciatic sinew prohibition was first given to Moses on Sinai, and it did not apply before then. However, when Moses recorded and arranged the Torah, he recorded this prohibition in the context of Jacob's encounter with the angel, to teach that this incident was the reason for the prohibition."
