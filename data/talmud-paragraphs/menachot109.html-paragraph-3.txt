 What is the story of the temple of Chonyo? When the Righteous High Priest Shimon died after eighty years of service, he appointed his son Chonyo as his successor. Chonyo's brother Shimi plotted to remove him: he tricked him to serve in his wife's clothes and told the priests that Chonyo did this out of love for his wife. Chonyo ran away and built his own temple. The Sages did not touch Shimi, to prevent him from acting even worse in pursuit of honor. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the story was the opposite: Chonyo plotted against Shimi, was discovered, and ran away.
