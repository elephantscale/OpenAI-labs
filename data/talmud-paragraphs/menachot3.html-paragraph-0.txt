Menachot 3 - According to Rabbi Shimon, All Flour Offerings Remain Valid Earlier we said that there are two cases of flour offering where the wrong intent ruins the sacrifice. This ruling, however, does not accord with Rabbi Shimon, who says that the action of one who brings the flour openly manifest its type, and the wrong intention does not matter at all. For example, if this offering was already baked on a griddle, this determines its type. In this the flour offering is different from an animal, where the slaughter is the same for all types of sacrifices.
