Menachot 16 - Libations are Rejected because the Sacrifice is Rejected Many sacrifices were accompanied by libations in the form of wine and flour. If the kohen had the wrong intent to eat the meat of the sacrifice beyond allotted time, then if the libations were already in a Temple vessel, they too became rejected - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Once the libations are put in a vessel, they become an integral part of the sacrifice. The Sages, however, disagree, since libations for a sacrifice can be brought many days after the sacrifice itself is brought.
