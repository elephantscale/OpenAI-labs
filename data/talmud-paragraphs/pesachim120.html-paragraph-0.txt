Pesachim 120 - Dessert The rule is that no dessert is served after eating the Passover offering. However, there are many ways to understand it. Some say that only one's favorite meats may not be eaten because they would overpower the Passover sacrifice's taste. Others, however, cite a different reason for the prohibition: one should not eat the sacrifice in two places, and if he were allowed desserts, then eventually he would come to eat them in a different place, and then perhaps even go to a different room with the Passover meat too.
