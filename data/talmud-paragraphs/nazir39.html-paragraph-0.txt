Nazir 39 - The direction of hair growth If a nazir shaves his head - or bandits grab him and shave it - he must wait at least thirty more days before concluding his term. This is because the standard (and the minimal) term is thirty days, and when he shaves his hair, it must have at least thirty days of growth.
