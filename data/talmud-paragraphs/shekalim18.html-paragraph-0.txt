Shekalim 18 - Thirteen tables There were thirteen tables in the Temple, each serving a specific purpose. Eight of them, made of marble, were used for skinning and washing the sacrifices before burning them. Among others, one was of marble, and on it, they would place the Bread of Vision ready to be brought into the Temple; inside the Temple, the bread lay on a golden table, and after a week of staying inside, but still fresh and warm, it was taken outside and put on another golden table, to be distributed among the priests. Why did they not put it back on the marble table? - Because of the rule that we bring things up in their level, try to never take them down. Another question: why put the bread on a table of marble; wouldn't silver be more dignified? The answer is that yes, it would be, but silver warms up, and the bread may spoil. But didn't we say that there was a miracle with this bread anyway, and it would not spoil or cool down? Also true, but we try not to rely on miracles.
