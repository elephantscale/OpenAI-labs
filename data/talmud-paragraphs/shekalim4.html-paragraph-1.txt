 From whom do they take a pledge? From Levite, Israelites, and converts. Women and minors may donate if they want. They did not take pledges from the Kohanim for the sake of peace. Why? When a Kohen brings a flour offering, it can not be eaten but is rather completely burned. Therefore - reasoned the Kohanim - how can we donate money for sacrifices? If we do, some of the sacrifices that we normally eat would be prohibited to eat! Some even said that any Kohen who gives half-shekel sins. The Sages, however, claim that any Kohen who does not give half-shekel sins, since if he gives wholeheartedly, it becomes the property of the community and not his own.
