Yoma 51 - The way to the Holy of Holies The High Priest continues on his way with the incense to the Holy of Holies. He walks through the Sanctuary until he reaches the two curtains that separate it and the Holy of Holies. The space between the two curtains measured one amah (about two feet). Rabbi Yose says there was only one curtain, as the Torah describes it, "And the curtain shall divide between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies."
