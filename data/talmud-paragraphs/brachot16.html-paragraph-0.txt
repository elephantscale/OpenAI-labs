Brachot 16 - Workers and Bridegroom Say Shema The workers may recite the Shema on top of the tree or on top of the wall of stones. If they started their work before the time to recite the morning Shema arrived, they are not required to descend, but can concentrate while saying the first phrase, and continue with the rest, where such extreme concentration is not required. However, they are not allowed do this with the Amidah (Standing prayer), since it requires long concentration, and they might be afraid to fall.
