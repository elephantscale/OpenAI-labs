Menachot 73 - Kometz, a Handful To take a kometz, or a handful, the kohen bends his three middle fingers against his palm, pushes his hand downward into the pieces of the flour offering, and then turns his hand upward. The portion scooped up in the Kohen's hand is a kometz, or handful, and what remains is remnants that are eaten by the kohanim.
