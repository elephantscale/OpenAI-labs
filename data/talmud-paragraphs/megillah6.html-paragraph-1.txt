 If someone tells you, "I worked on studying Torah but did not succeed," - do not believe him. Also, don't believe if he says, "I did not work on my studies and nevertheless succeeded." However, if he says, "I worked hard, and I succeeded," - believe him because the two go together. That is only true in understanding, but retaining the knowledge is a gift from Heaven. With regards to business, it is all luck and help from Heaven.
