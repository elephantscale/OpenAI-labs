Nazir 9 - Nazir who did not like figs If one says, "I am a nazir, so I cannot eat figs," - this is a strange statement. Being a nazir means specifically abstaining from grapes, nothing else. However, Beit Shammai says that he does become a nazir nevertheless. How so? People usually do not make nonsensical statements. This one probably wanted to become a nazir but added that he meant figs. He could have made a mistake, thinking there was such a thing. Or, he really could have changed his mind and was preparing a loophole for himself. But the problem is that Beit Shammai does not accept the idea of changing one's mind regarding Temple-related things. So either way, he becomes a nazir.
