 But why should the meat ever become impure? Any food, to become impure, must first become wet with water. While the animal is alive, it cannot become impure, and they have just slaughtered it!? It cannot be any liquid in the Temple, because these are all pure. Nor can it be the impurity declared out of love for holy things, because such impurity was only declared on object themselves, not giving them the power to transmit impurity further. Rav Yehudah gave the answer: the owner led the cow through a river on the way to the Temple, to wash it off, and this water was still dripping. Since the owner wanted this water to be on a cow, all preconditions for impurity are fulfilled.
