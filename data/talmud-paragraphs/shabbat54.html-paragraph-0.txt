Shabbat 54 - What animal may not wear If an animal wears something which it does not need, but which is there for the needs of its Jewish owner, then the owner made it carry something in the public area, and carrying on Shabbat is prohibited. What are the examples of such items? A camel may not go with a saddle cloth, since if it falls, the owner of the camel might carry it further. Nor may it go out bound (with its legs chained together) or hobbled (with its one lower foreleg bent upward toward the upper foreleg and tied). These cause pain to the animal, and are hence not welcomed by it and are a burden. In fact, this applies to any animal.
