Rosh Hashanah 6 - A promise to charity is immediate Earlier, we saw that the phrase "do not be late in paying" applies to many kinds of promises, including charity. However, the charity has a unique aspect to it. Whereas a promised sacrifice needs to be brought before one, two, or more Holidays pass - depending upon which opinion you follow - the obligation to give charity is immediate. One violates the "do not delay" prohibition by not paying. Why is that? Simply because the responsibility to bring a sacrifice is active only when there is a chance to do so, but poor people are found at all times. It is thus not related to any occasion or Festival.
