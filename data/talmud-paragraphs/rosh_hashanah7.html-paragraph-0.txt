Rosh Hashanah 7 - The month of Nisan The month of Nisan is unique in many respects; in particular, it is the first in the order of months. Why? - Since the Torah said, "This month will be for you the first... take a lamb for each household," we know that the Exodus happened in the first month. But how do we know that it is Nisan? - Because the Torah also said, "Watch the month of the first ripened produce," and this must be the spring month of Nisan. But perhaps it is Iyar, which immediately follows Nisan and which you also have ripened produce? - No, it could not be Iyar because "the first ripened produce" grows before. Then say that it is Adar, which precedes Nisan? - Also, no, because we need the majority of "the first ripened produce." So your proof is based on that? - But did the Torah say "the majority of the first ripened produce?" - No, it did not. Thus, this proof is abandoned, and the Talmud starts another.
