Pesachim 37 - Cookies baked by Baitus The Sages taught, "One cannot bake 'thick bread' on Passover - so says Beit Shammai, but Beit Hillel allows it." What could this mean? If it means bread one hand-breadth thick like they used to bake in the Temple, without giving it a chance to leaven - then how can Beit Hillel allow it? Obviously, priests in the Temple could be trusted to use dry wood, hot metal ovens, etc., but not the general populace. Rather, this particular rule is just talking about abundant bread, and Beit Shammai forbids it simply because it is too much work for a holiday. If so, it should apply to all holidays! - You are right, it is, just that our teacher was teaching it on Passover, so he used the Passover name.
