 If a tenant-farmer leased a field from his fellow, and the crop was blasted by the wind which reduced its quality, he may pay his rental out of this crop. If the wheat of that crop was superior, the tenant cannot buy wheat of average quality, but must give the landowner his payment out of that produce.
