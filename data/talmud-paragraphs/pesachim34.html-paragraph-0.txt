Pesachim 34 - Planting the priest's portion Abaye and Chananiah, son of Avin, were learning about priest's portion (terumah) in the academy of Rabbah - who was quite a personality, see here. Rava met them and asked what new have they learned. They replied, "And what problem do you have?" Rava told them that he could not understand the following ruling: If a priest's portion of grain became impure and one planted it, then this grain cannot make other food impure, but it itself is still forbidden to be eaten. The earth should purify it!
