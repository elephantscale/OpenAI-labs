 But is it Rabbi Meir's way to be concerned with improbabilities? For example, if one buys wine that may not have been tithed and needs to drink it on Shabbat, he can separate the tithe in his mind and do it physically after Shabbat - and there Rabbi Meir is not concerned that the wine bag will break and leave him with no tithe! - He will answer that it is more likely for an animal to die than for a wineskin to break.
