Moed Katan 18 - Nail biting Untrimmed nails give a man an unkempt appearance. Just as the Sages prohibited one from cutting his hair on the holiday weekdays (so that one should do this before and appear groomed for the Holiday), they also prohibited pairing the nails. Others say that there is no such enactment - either because people are careful about nails and no enactment is needed or because nails grow too fast. An additional law would inconvenience people. This is where nail-biting may be helpful because one may be prohibited from using scissors but not bite or remove nails with other nails.
