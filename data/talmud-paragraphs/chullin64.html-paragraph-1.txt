 If an egg has a spot of blood in it, then if it is only in the place of the embryo, one can discard the blood and eat the egg, but if it is in another place, then one can assume the whole egg started developing, and it is forbidden. Some say that the place of an embryo is in the connection to the yolk, others that it is in the yolk, and still others that it is in the egg white. The custom has thus become to discard an egg with any blood spot.
