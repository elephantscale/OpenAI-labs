Sanhedrin 8 - One Who Defames His Wife Claims against a rapist, a seducer, and the claim of a defamer are judged by the court of three - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages says that the claim of a defamer is judged by a court of twenty three (small Sanhedrin), because cases of defamation include capital cases.
