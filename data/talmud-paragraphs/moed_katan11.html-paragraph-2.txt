 If this happens in the middle of a festival, the law is similar on holiday weekdays (chol ha moed). Some say that the rules or a mourner are stricter: since they are only decreed by the Sages and not the Torah law, the Sages gave it even more severity so that the people should not treat mourning lightly. Others, however, maintain just the opposite and say that the decrees of the Sages (mourning) cannot be stricter than the laws of the Torah (festivals).
