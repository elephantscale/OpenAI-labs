Chullin 19 - Shechitah - Third Outside, Third Inside, and Third Outside If one cut one-third part of the trachea above the designated area, then his knife went downward, and he cut one-third within the designated area, and then again cut the remaining third outside the designated area, then Rav Huna says in the name of Rav that the animal is kosher, while Rav Yehudah says in the name of Rav that it is not kosher.
