Yoma 38 - What is bad? While earlier we mentioned the good deeds and stopped to praise the people who performed them, now we need to mention the bad ones. The family of Garmu possessed the secret of baking the Bread of Vision for the Temple so that it would never crumble, and they did not want to teach this to anybody. Their official excuse was that they did not want it to fall into the wrong hands and be used in the service of idols. However, they were praised for never giving refined bread to their children so that nobody would suspect them of using the Temple bread.
