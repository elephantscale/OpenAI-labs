Chullin 49 - A Needle Found in the Liver There was once a case of a needle found in the liver of an animal, and Mar the son of Rav Yosef was inclined to rule the animal terefah. Rav Ashi said to him, "Why is this worse than a needle in an ordinary piece of meat? Rather, I look at the position of the needle. If its head it sticking out of the liver, then clearly it has come into the liver by way of puncturing from the outside, and thus has made an animal a terefah, because it punctured the digestive track. But if the head is inside, then it must have taken the vascular route and is beginning to exit out of the liver, thus the animal is kosher."
