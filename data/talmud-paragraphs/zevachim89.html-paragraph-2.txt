 The Torah said, "and the second bull you will take as a sin-offering." The word "second" is extra - we can count and know that it is the second - rather it teaches that it is brought second. On the other hand, it said, "one bull a sin-offering, another - a burnt-offering," so which one comes first? - Sin-offering, since it effects forgiveness, has its blood brought first. Burnt-offering, since it is burned completely, has its limbs burned first.
