Nedarim 85 - I am not giving anything to Kohanim and Levites! If a man makes a vow prohibiting the Kohanim and the Levites to benefit from his property, he achieves nothing. After he separates from his crop those tithes that are due to them - he does not own them any longer. Therefore, they can take tithes against his will. Even though he usually can choose which Kohen or Levy to give it to and even accept a small tip for it, now that he forbade this produce to them anyway, he has no right to it either. Thus, he is not providing them with any benefit whatsoever.
