 One time a husband entered a house where a man, known for his adventures with women, was hiding. The husband wanted to eat some cress, but the hiding man saw that a snake had tasted it, so he warned the husband. The question arose: Was the man's wife now prohibited to him because of possible adultery? Rava said that she was permitted, for had infidelity really happened, the man would instead prefer to see the husband dead. Rava supported his view with the quote, "They committed adultery, and the blood is on their hands."
