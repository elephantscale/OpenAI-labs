 Is a sodomized bird valid for the Altar? Since the relationship is not reciprocal and the bird cannot sodomize a human, then perhaps even if the bird was sodomized, it can still be brought as a sacrifice, or, after all, since a sin was committed with it, maybe it is invalid? The answer: since the sodomized bird is not mentioned in the list of disqualified offerings that may remain on the Altar because there are situation when they are permitted (bird cannot sodomize a human), then perforce a sodomized bird is never valid as a sacrifice.
