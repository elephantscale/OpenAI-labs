 In general, can Kohanim wear the service garments outside the Temple? Let us consider the following story. During the time of Shimon the Righteous, the Karaites convinced Alexander Macedon that Jews were organizing a rebellion, and he went to destroy Jerusalem. Shimon, the High Priest, donned his garments and went to meet him. Both parties walked all night and met at sunrize when Alexander descended from his chariot and bowed down to Shimon. He explained that he saw this man in a vision every time he went to battle, praying for him. Alexander then gave the Karaites into the hands of the Jews, who dragged them tied to horses to the Karaite Temple on Mount Gerizim, and destroyed it.
