Shabbat 28 - Wick made of wood Any material that comes from a tree should not a be used to make a wick for the Shabbat lamp, since it does not draw oil well - with the exception of flax. Incidentally, materials coming from a tree, if used to construct a roof over a dead body, do not themselves become ritually impure - again, with the exception of flax.
