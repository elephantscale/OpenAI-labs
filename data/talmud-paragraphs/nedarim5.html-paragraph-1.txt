 Shmuel says, "He has to specify what exactly is forbidden." If he does not, there is no vow at all. This is because Shmuel follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah about a Get: It is not enough to put into the Get "You are hereby permitted to all men." This may still mean that he divorces her with the verbal statement and treats the Get as a confirmation. Instead, he needs to write, "This will be for you the document of removal, bill of release, and letter of abandonment."
