 An Israelite woman should not deliver the child of an idolatress, because she thereby delivers a child for idolatry. However, if she can't find an excuse, she is allowed to do it so as not to provoke enmity. An idolatress may deliver a child of an Israelite woman, provided that others are there to watch her.
