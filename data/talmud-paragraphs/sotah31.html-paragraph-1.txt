 Rabbi Yehoshua says that the evidence of seclusion must be more substantial: if the affair is the talk of the town, so that women who get together to weave and chat at night discuss this, then the situation is certain to the point that the water drinking test will not work anyway. It is not, however, certain to the point of her losing the Ketubah, so in that situation, the husband still pays.
