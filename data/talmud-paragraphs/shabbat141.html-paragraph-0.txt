Shabbat 141 - The advice of Rav Chisda The Talmud lists multiple pieces of advice given by Rav Chisda, on frugal diet and abstinence, on keeping the clothes good-looking throughout the year, by buying expensive materials which last longer, and even to his daughters, couched in veiled terms, on the importance of foreplay. All of these, however, have mystical connotations. For example, when Rav Chisda says that he did not eat much vegetables either when he was poor or when he was rich, he means being poor and rich in Torah knowledge. The reason not to indulge in vegetables was that to achieve the tikkun, correction of the souls that are reincarnated in a vegetable, one has to possess the power to elevate them two levels, in the hierarchy of plants-animals-man, whereas for meat one only has to achieve one-step elevation. Today the logic is reversed, and the adverse spiritual effect of meat on our bodies outweighs the needs of the tikkun, so that the student is advised to be vegetarian throughout the week, and eat meat or foul only on Shabbat.
