 If the ox of a Jew gored the ox of a Canaanite, the Jew is exempt, but if the ox of a Canaanite gored the ox of a Jew, the Canaanite pays full damages - a penalty on Canaanites who had no court system and were generally not careful about other people's possessions (Meiri), thus not applicable today.
