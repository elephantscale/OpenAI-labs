Yevamot 30 - What does the intent to marry accomplish? We saw that the Sages instituted "an intent to marry" in the case of yibum, which looks like a regular engagement. Note, however, that the couple is already married in some sense: the mitzvah of yibum is accomplished by intercourse, and strictly speaking, no other formalities are required. Therefore, what does the declaration of this intent accomplish, an engagement or a complete marriage?
