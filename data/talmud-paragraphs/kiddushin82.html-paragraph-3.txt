 The bride is symbolic of Tzedek - righteousness and also of being poor. When she is given a coin - a prutah - the minimum amount for giving, she becomes symbolic of Tzedakah, charity. She then turns her face to the groom, and this face-to-face meeting, symbolic of God talking to Moses, prepares them for the honor of Chupah.
