Makkot 9 - Exile for Inadvertent Killing A blind person who killed inadvertently is not exiled, since "without seeing" excludes him from responsibility - says Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Meir says that there is another exclusion, "without awareness," and double negative becomes affirmative, so a blind inadvertent killer is exiled.
