 What is a proper blessing on palm shoots (the new growth, which is soft and edible)? Rav Yehudah says that since right now it is fruit, it deserves the blessing of "Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the ground." However, Shmuel, his teacher, says that since eventually it will harden and become bark, then even now it has the regular blessing of any food, "Blessed is the One Who created everything by His word." Shmuel then praised his favorite student, saying "Sharp one! You position is more reasonable, since on radishes, although they eventually harden, people say the blessing of the fruit of the ground." But even though Shmuel praised his student, the law does not follow his student. Why not? Radishes are planted with the intention to eat them soft, even though they will harden. Palms, however, are not planted for eating their shoots.
