Gittin 22 - Who can write the Get? Everybody can write a Get (divorce document), even people who are normally not considered completely responsible for their actions, such as a deaf-mute or deranged person, or anyone below bat/bar-mitzvah age. It goes without saying that a woman can write a Get, provided that she transfers its ownership to the husband, who can then give "his" Get to her. It is not the writing of the Get that matters, it is the signatures of the witnesses!
