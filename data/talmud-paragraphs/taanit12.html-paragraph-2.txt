 Rav Yehoshua visited the home of Rav Idi, and they made a special meal for him, a calf one-third grown. He said, "I can't eat; I am fasting." They told him, "Do this: cancel this fast and repay it later!" He answered, "My fast has a reason: I saw a bad dream. In that case, you cannot change the day since the fast must be on the day of the dream." That is true even on Shabbat, except that on Shabbat, one should not fast - so what does one do? Fast now, and then fast again on a weekday, to atone for his fasting on Shabbat.
