Avodah Zarah 49 - Mixture of Forbidden and Permitted Causes is Permitted One should not sit in the shadow of a tree that was worshipped, but if he did sit in the shadow, though not under the tree itself, he is still pure. If he sat directly under branches or foliage - he is ritually impure, because he was under "the same roof" with offerings to an idol.
