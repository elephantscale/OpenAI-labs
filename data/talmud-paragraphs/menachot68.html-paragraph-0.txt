Menachot 68 - Remembering the Temple We learned that Rabbi Yehudah does not establish a preventive decree to stop people from eating new grain before its time, but the Sages do. However, we saw them having the opposite views! For example, if one missed searching for leaven before Passover, Rabbi Yehudah prohibits him to search, lest he comes to eat it. The answer is that Rabbi Yehudah is not worried about new grain, because people do not eat it all year, but they do eat leaven. And the Sages? They say, he is searching for leaven to burn it, will he eat it?
