Chullin 31 - Shechitah Must Be Done With A Sawing Motion If one chopped off the head of an animal, the shechitah is invalid because it must be done with a drawn-out, saw-like motion. Therefore, if he cut the head off with one motion, it is valid - provided that the knife was twice as long as the neck, so that he can accomplish the cut without going back and forth. If he used the back-and-forth motion, it is valid, and then the knife can be as small as a scalpel. If he cut off two animal heads in one motion, it is valid, provided that the knife is thrice as long as one neck. Two people can do a shechitah together, as long as they don't press.
