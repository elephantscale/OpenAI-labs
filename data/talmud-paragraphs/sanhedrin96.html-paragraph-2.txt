 Nebuzaradan saw the blood of Zechariah, seething on the floor of the Temple. He asked, "What is it?" They told him, "Blood of offerings that spilled." He brought offerings, but it did not look the same. He then threatened torture, and they told him the truth: Zechariah prophesied about the destruction of the Temple, and they killed him, a Kohen and a prophet. Nebuzaradan then brought the Sages and slew them over the blood, but it did not rest. He killed schoolchildren and Kohanim, and kept killing until the count came to 940,000. He then called to Zechariah, "Do you want me to kill everyone?" - and the blood rested.
