Brachot 50 - How to invite to prayer As we learned before, if at least three people ate together, they must call each other to join in the after-meal prayer. One should include himself in the call and say "Let us bless Him Whose food we have eaten," and if there are ten or more, he adds the name of God, saying, "Let us bless God..." If there are more than ten, he still calls them in the same way - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva, who compares this to a prayer leader in the synagogue: such leader does not turn back to count the number of people, and does not change his words based on the size of the group.
