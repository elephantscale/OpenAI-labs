 Rabbi Shimon says that the derivation is different: animal tithe was included in the laws of exchange, together with all other animals. When the Torah then repeated this, it is teaching us something new, namely, the exception that "improves" the rule, that is, teaches something about it. Just as tithe can only separated by an individual, so too exchange can only done by an individual. Parenthetically, just as tithe is an Altar offering, so should be animals subject to exchange - which excludes offerings made for Temple maintenance.
