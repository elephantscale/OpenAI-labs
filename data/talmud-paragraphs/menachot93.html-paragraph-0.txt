Menachot 93 - Who Has to Perform Leaning on the Sacrifices Basically, personal sacrifices require one to lean on them and recite either his guilt or his thanksgiving to God. However, there are some people who are exempt from this requirement. Thus, a deaf-mute, a deranged person, and a minor don't have the requirement of leaning, because they are not legally competent. In truth, since they cannot even consecrate an offering or bring it of their own free will, they are very rarely in a situation where leaning would be discussed.
