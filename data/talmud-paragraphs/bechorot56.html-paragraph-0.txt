Bechorot 56 - Tithes for Animals Bought or Exchanged for Services If one buys untithed animals or receives them as a gift, he does not have to tithe them. The Torah compared tithes to a firstborn son, and just as children are born into a family and not acquired, so too only animals born in one's herd are tithed. Rabbi Yochanan said: "If one buys ten fetuses in the wombs of their mothers, they will be subject to tithes." Why? Rabbi Elazar said "I saw Rabbi Yochanan in a dream, so my explanation today must be correct." The Torah said, "So shall you do (tithe)" to exclude animals acquired though an additional act of buying.
