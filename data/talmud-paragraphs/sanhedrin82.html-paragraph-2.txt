 If a zealot comes to ask about this ruling, he is not told about it, and not given the permission. He has to know it from before and then take the risk in his own hands. Furthermore, he can only do it while the sinner is engaged in his sin. If the sinner stops, and the zealot kills him then, the zealot is responsible for murder.
