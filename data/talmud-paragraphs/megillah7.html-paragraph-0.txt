Megillah 7 - One must get inebriated on Purim If an extra month is added to a year, this month is Adar. It is on this second Adar that Purim must be observed. Some say that it must be on the first Adar. Both derive their opinion from the exact same words in the Megillah, "each and every year." This means "connect the redemption of Purim with Passover and designate the second Adar." Others say it means to do like very year, where Adar follow the previous month of Shvat.
