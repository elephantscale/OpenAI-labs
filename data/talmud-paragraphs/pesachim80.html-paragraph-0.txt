Pesachim 80 - The forgiving power of the tzitz Tzitz is the golden head plate worn by the High Priest. It fixed the defects of sacrifices, but not all the defects. Thus, if someone brought his Passover offering and even threw its blood on the Altar, but then they discovered that the meat or the blood became ritually impure, it is the tzitz that effects the acceptance. What is the use of acceptance if the meat cannot eaten? At least, he has fulfilled his obligation and won't have to bring another sacrifice. He will eat matzah and other things at the Seder.
