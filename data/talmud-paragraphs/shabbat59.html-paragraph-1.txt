 To illustrate, consider a metal shoe of an animal. For impurity, what use can it be fit for if not worn by an animal? Rav says, to drink from it in battle; Rav Chanina says, to anoint oil with it for the battle; Rabbi Yochanan says, to use it to flee from battle, stepping over thorns. Their disagreement is about how close to the original use does the new use have to be. The differences between them emerge when it is dirty (you won't drink from it) or when it is heavy (you won't run in it).
