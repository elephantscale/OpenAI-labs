Zevachim 87 - The Airspace of the Altar A sacrifice that remained overnight becomes invalid. Is it also true if it already was on top of the Altar? Do we compare the Altar to the show-bread Table, where the bread can stay for any length of time, or do we compare it to the ground of the Courtyard? Rava sides with the first opinion, but Abbaye did not agree with him.
