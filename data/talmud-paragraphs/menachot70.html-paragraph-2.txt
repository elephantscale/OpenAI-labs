 For many laws the following species are special: wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. One who makes dough from them is obligated to give challah - the first portion of the dough - to a kohen. They combine with each other to form the amount (about 5 pounds) necessary for challah. It is forbidden to eat them before the Omer is brought, and it is forbidden to harvest them before Passover. The Omer permits them as long as they have taken root before it. These species that can leaven and become prohibited on Passover, and these same species are what matzah is made of.
