 One should tear open the udder prior to cooking and extract its milk. If he did not tear it open and prepared it as is, he does not transgress on account of it. Rabbi Zeira said, "It is permitted to consume the udder prepared with its milk." But we just learned that "one does not transgress on account of it." This seemed to imply that it is prohibited by the Sages, only that one does not transgress the Torah!? Rabbi Zeira was talking about roasting, where the milk drips off, and the ruling - about boiling, where the milk gets out, becomes prohibited, then gets reabsorbed.
