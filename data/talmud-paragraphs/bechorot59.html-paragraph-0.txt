Bechorot 59 - Tithing Procedure To tithe, one gathers his animals into a pen, and makes a small opening for them, so that two animals can't exit at once. He counts them with a staff: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and the one that exits tenth he marks with red dye, and pronounces, "This one is hereby tithe."
