 Rabbi Yochanan said that there is a connection between shoes and tefillin: just as arm tefillin is work on the left arm, which shows its importance, so too one should put on the left shoe first. However, there is a contradictory general rule that the right should always take precedence. Therefore, one should try to behave himself according to both views. How can this be accomplished? He puts on the right shoe first, but when he ties them, he ties the left shoe first.
