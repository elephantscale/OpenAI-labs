Yoma 27 - The hide Depending upon the type of the offering, a varying number of Kohanim was required. Thus, a ram was offered by eleven and a bull - by twenty-four priests. Each carried his own part of the animal; for the larger parts, more than one priest was required, and the flour offering, which consisted of three "hin" measures (about 3 liters each), each Kohen was bringing a "hin" in its own vessel. This was only done for communal offerings, for added honor, but for a private offering, if its owner designated one Kohen, this Kohen could bring the whole thing. For flaying and cutting up the sacrifices into parts - everybody was equal in that respect.
