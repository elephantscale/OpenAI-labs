 Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha says on the contrary that before the verdict it is a meritorious deed for a judge to arbitrate a compromise - "...execute truth and judgment of piece...", and "judgment of piece" means compromise - like king David, who "...rendered judgment and righteousness..." And Rabbi Eliezer explains that king David would render a strict judgment first, but then if the loosing party was poor, he would pay his own money.
