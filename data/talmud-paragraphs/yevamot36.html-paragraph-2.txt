 However, Resh Lakish disagrees on all counts and declares the chalitzah or yibum invalid. As far as Elijah and his knowledge of the future - Resh Lakish answers that right now, at least, we do not know the future and should judge accordingly, not using the logic of retroactively changing the meaning of current events based on the future outcomes. And as far as the rule of "the marriage can continue" - which seems to imply that the original yibum was valid - Resh Lakish will answer that it was not. Instead, a new yibum is required, and the marriage can continue.
