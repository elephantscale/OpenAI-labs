 A beam that is placed across the entrance into an alley must not be higher than twenty amot (about 40 feet). If it is higher, it must be placed lower. The Talmud immediately asks: we will learn that a sukkah must not be higher than twenty amot, and if it is higher than that, it is invalid. Why "invalid" for sukkah but "placed lower" for an alley? The answer: since the sukkah requirement is dictated by the Torah, then the Sages just tell you the law, "invalid." The beam over an alley, however, is dictated by the Sages themselves, and as they explain it, they can also tell you how to fix it.
