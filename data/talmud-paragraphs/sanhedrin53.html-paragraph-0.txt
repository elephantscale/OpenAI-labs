Sanhedrin 53 - Who is Stoned Following is the procedure for those who are strangled: they would submerge him in manure up to his knees, to prevent jumping and to shorten the agony. They would place a hard scarf inside a soft one and wind it around his neck. One witness pulls toward himself and the other witness pulls to himself, until his souls departs.
