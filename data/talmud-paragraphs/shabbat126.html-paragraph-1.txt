 What kinds of food can he move? He can move the Kohen's portion, even though only the Kohanim can eat it - provided that it is ritually pure and thus can altogether be used. Furthermore, he can move "d'mai" - produce from which the tithes perhaps have not been separated, and which it is consequently prohibited to eat. If so, how can he move it, if it is unusable? - He can give up his possessions and become poor, and eat it with this subterfuge. He may also move lupines - a sort of beans - since they are fit for goats.
