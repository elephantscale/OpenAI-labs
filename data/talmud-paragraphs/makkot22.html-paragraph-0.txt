Makkot 22 - How Are Lashes Administered The maximum number of lashes that can be given is thirty-nine, because it says "in the number of forty". Rabbi Yehudah says that this means exactly forty. The court assesses how many lashes the transgressor can stand, and chooses a number divisible by three. If in the middle of giving him lashes he appears weak, they stop the lashes, and he does not have to endure more.
