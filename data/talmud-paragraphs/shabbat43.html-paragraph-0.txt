Shabbat 43 - Corpse in the sun If one has an oil lamp that is leaking oil, he nevertheless may not put a plate next to the lamp, in order to collect the dripping oil. Why not? - The oil in the lamp is designated to be burned on Shabbat, and it is not designated for consumption. Therefore, the oil is considered "not prepared for use," or "muktzeh", and muktzeh objects cannot be handled or used on Shabbat. When one puts a plate to collect the oil, he effectively "cements" the plate to the floor: since the plate with the muktzeh oil may be not carried any longer, it is as if glued to the floor, and he has thus performed the prohibited labor of building on Shabbat.
