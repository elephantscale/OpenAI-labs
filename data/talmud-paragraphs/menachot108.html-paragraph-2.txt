 If one promised a specific ox as a burned offering and the ox became blemished, his obligation disappears. Unlike the previous cases, he promised a specific animal and not a sacrifice in general, and once this animal cannot be brought as a sacrifice, he is free from his obligation. He still needs to redeem the ox, and the money then acquires holiness and has to be used for a burned offering, but he can buy greater or smaller animals with it.
