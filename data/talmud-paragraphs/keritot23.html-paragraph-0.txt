Keritot 23 - Two People Ate Two Pieces Of Meat If there were two pieces of meat, one ordinary, and another of consecrated meat, and one person ate one of them, the Sages say that he need not bring an offering of uncertainty, but Rabbi Akiva says that he does. This is the ruling we saw before. However, if now he ate the second piece, then all agree that he needs to bring a guilt-offering for misappropriation of Temple property.
