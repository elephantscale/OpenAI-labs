 And yet, we do worry about weasels, since all food that is left over after the search for chametz is hidden and not put in an easily accessible place - obviously because a weasel may take it away. Abaye explained, "Yes, the weasel may hide it just before Pesach when soon there will be no bread available, but not earlier when there is plenty." Rava objected, "Is a weasel a prophetess that she knows that soon there will be no bread?! - Rather, the danger is that the weasel will take it away in one's presence, and then he will have to search again."
