Sukkah 3 - The smallest possible sukkah Rav Itzhak bar Shmuel stated the law: the smallest possible sukkah has to be no less than seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths so that one can fit in it his head, most of his body, and his table. They asked him, "But this is the opinion of Beit Shammai, and we know that whenever Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai argue, the law is always like Beit Hillel!?" He answered, "And what should I do? In this case, Beit Shammai is correct."
