 If an animal carrying its first miscarried an amniotic sac, it may or may not have been a male firstborn, and even if it was a male, it may have been deformed, therefore it can thrown to the dogs. However, if the mother was a sacrifice, the sac needs to be buried -- because both male and female young would be sanctified.
