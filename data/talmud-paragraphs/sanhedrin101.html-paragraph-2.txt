 Now Chizkiah his father taught Torah to the entire world. Of course, he taught his son Menasheh too. Nevertheless, with all the trouble that Chizkiah took with Menasheh to teach him the path of righteousness, in the end it was sufferings that elevated Menasheh to proper conduct: "God brought upon the people the king of Assyria, and they captured Menasheh with hooks and transported him to Babylon. When Menasheh was in distress, he humbled himself greatly before the God of his father, and God returned him to Jerusalem".
