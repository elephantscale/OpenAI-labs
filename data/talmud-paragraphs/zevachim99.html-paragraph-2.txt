 Any kohen who was disqualified at any point of the service - for example, if he was impure when the blood was thrown but later, when the fats were burned, he became pure - does not have a share in that offering. And one who does not have a share in the meat does not have a share in the hides. This is derived from the Torah phrase "The one from the among the sons of Aharon who offers (that is, who is fit to offer) the blood of the peace offering and the fat - the right thigh shall be his portion."
