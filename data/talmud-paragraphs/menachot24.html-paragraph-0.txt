Menachot 24 - Two Flour Offerings In One Vessel When Rav Kahana came to Israel, he met the sons of Rabbi Chiya who were pondering the following question: If one put two halves of his flour offering in a vessel so that they do not touch, and then a spiritually impure person touched one of the halves, does this make the other half impure? The rule is that a vessel combines the parts, but is it true even for impurity? Rav Kahana gave an answer from the wording of the rule, which does not state that it joins the halves, but only that it combines. This means that they are not joined for impurity.
