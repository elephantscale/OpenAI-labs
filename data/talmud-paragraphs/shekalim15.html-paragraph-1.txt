 There were two chambers in the Temple, the chamber of secrets and the chamber of tools. People who wanted to give charity would put the money in the chamber of secrets, and the descendants of good families who lost their wealth would come and secretly take it from there. The Talmud tells a few stories about the importance of giving charity and acting wisely so as not to embarrass the recipient. One of such stories: Rabbi Chama was strolling among the synagogues of Lod, and he told his colleague, Rabbi Hoshaya, "See how much money did my ancestors sink into these beautiful synagogues!" To this, Rabbi Hoshaya replied, "See how many lives did your ancestors sink! Were there no people struggling to study Torah that they could have supported instead?!"
