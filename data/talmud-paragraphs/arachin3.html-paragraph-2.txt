 One may force ALL the members of his household to move to Israel. This ruling reflects the opinion that living in Israel is a commandment, based on the Torah phrase, "Clear out the land and live in it." ALL adds one who would have to give up a beautiful dwelling outside Israel and move to inferior quarters in Israel. Other cases of using the word "all" include sukkah, lulav, tzitzit, tefillin, Temple visits, shofar, megillah, impurity discharge, spiritual leprosy, and kosher slaughter of animals.
