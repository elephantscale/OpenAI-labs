 Before Passover they prepared the barley by tying it into bundles. On the night after the first day of Passover, a crowd went to that field. Once it became dark, the reaper would ask them, "Has the sun set?" and they answered "Yes." This dialog repeated three times. Then he asked "This sickle?", "This basket?" and they would answer yes, and repeat. On Shabbat, he would ask "Is it Shabbat?" Then he would say, "Shall I reap?", they would answer "Reap!" This repeated three times. Why was all this necessary? Because of those who said that the barley had to be brought on the first Saturday night after the Festival.
