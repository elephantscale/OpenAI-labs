Zevachim 32 - Anybody Can Slaughter a Sacrifice All those who were previously mentioned as disqualifying the service can do the first step - the slaughter. This is based on the phrase "He shall slaughter the bull before God and the sons of Aaron, the Kohanim, shall bring the blood to the Altar and throw it on the Altar." From here we see only beginning from the second step of the service - receiving the blood - do we require a Kohen, but anybody can do the slaughter.
