 One can slaughter, cook, and eat animals on a Yom Tov, because although work, in general, is prohibited, preparing food is permitted. Furthermore, if one slaughters foul or wild animals, he needs to cover their blood with earth. However, digging earth on a Yom Tov is prohibited because it is akin to plowing or building, and in addition, the earth is muktzeh - set aside and not prepared for use on a Yom. Nevertheless, Beit Shammai permits one to dig with a spade and cover the blood with earth, whereas Beit Hillel requires the earth to be prepared on the previous day.
