 Rav Chiya bar Avin asked a question: if the congregation does not have enough animals for both the daily offering and the additional Mussaf offerings for Shabbat or a Holiday, which one of them takes precedence? What exactly is his question? If you will say that it is about the regular and additional offerings on the same day, then it cannot be correct - for daily offerings are clearly more frequent and they are also holy, so of course they come first. It must be that he asked about the additional offerings of today and the daily offerings of tomorrow. But that seems to be exactly the rule above, which must be talking about the same circumstance, where there is not enough animals! - Not necessarily. Perhaps the "non essential" rule above applies when they had enough animals, and it says that if they reversed the order, it is still valid. But it does not answer Ravi Chiya's question about not having enough animals.
