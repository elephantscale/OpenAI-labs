 A non-Jew does not need to eat kosher meat. Since the Torah said, "And you shall slaughter... and you may eat," one who does not need to eat kosher meat cannot slaughter it either. Therefore, if he did slaughter it, the animal becomes a nevelah, same as if it died by itself, and its meat conveys ritual impurity, which was important when the Temple was standing. It is not, however, prohibited for benefit - as would be the case with idol sacrifices - because today's idolaters are considered idol-worshipers by rote, and not out of ideological conviction.
