Brachot 18 - When one's dead lies before him One whose dead relative lies before him is exempt from the Shema prayer, from the Amidah (Standing) prayer, from donning tefillin, and from all other mitzvot stated in the Torah - although he cannot violate any prohibitions. That is so, because he is preoccupied with the mitzvah of burial, just as a bridegroom was preoccupied with the mitzvah of consummating the marriage. This refers to his seven immediate relatives: mother, father, daughter, son, sister, brother, and spouse.
