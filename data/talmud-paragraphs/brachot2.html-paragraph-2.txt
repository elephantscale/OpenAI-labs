 Why did the teacher not state simply, "nightfall," and instead talked about Kohanim coming home? - Because he wanted to teach an additional rule in passing, that the Kohanim can start eating their portion at night, after immersion. That is true even if they had a severe impurity, such as that of a zav, and still, need to bring a sacrifice - that offering does not prevent them from eating their kohen's portion.
