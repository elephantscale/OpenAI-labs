Bava Batra 163 - Prevention of Document Forgeries One empty line between the document's text and the signatures of witnesses is to be expected, but two make it invalid, because this opens up the document to forgery. The space of the two lines is measured in the larger handwriting of witnesses, and not in the smaller handwriting of the professional scribe. We assume that anybody who falsifies a document does it himself, and does not go to a scribe.
