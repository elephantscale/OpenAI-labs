 The thanksgiving offering was made of two measures called "ephah," which equaled twenty "tenths" or "issaron," or approximately 100 pounds of flour. In the desert, they used a measure called "se'ah," and this amounted to six se'ah. When they came to Jerusalem, they increased all measures by 20%, so in new measures this was not six but five se'ah.
