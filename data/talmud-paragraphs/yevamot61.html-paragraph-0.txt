Yevamot 61 - Whom the High Priest can marry A Kohen may not marry a woman who converted to Judaism. However, Rabbi Shimon, who usually understands and ascribes reasons for the laws of the Torah, says that the logic here is that a convert may have had relations with someone prohibited to her. Therefore, if a girl converts before the age of three, her cohabitation - even if she is violated - does not carry the disqualification power of an adult, and she can marry a Kohen.
