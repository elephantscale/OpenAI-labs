Menachot 42 - Make Tzitzit on the Garment, not Attach a Garment to Tzitzit The Torah says, "You will make yourself tzitzit on the corners of your garment." This means that the tzitzit is made when the garment is completed. If one made the tzitzit first, before the garment became obligated in tzitit, he would be wearing the tzitzit that was already made from before, not the one that he attached to the garment, and so it would be invalid. For example, if the garment tore, and he sewed it back with a woolen thread, then changed his mind and decided to use the thread as tzitzit, it would not be valid.
