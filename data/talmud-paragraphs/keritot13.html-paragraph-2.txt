 Consequently, if a Kohen drank a quarter of a "log" of wine (about 30 milliliters), during the time that it takes to eat a half a loaf of bread, he is forbidden to enter the Temple to perform service. After the Torah prohibits Kohanim from serving in the Temple while drunk, it continues to say that he needs to "Distinguish between the sacred and profaned, permitted and forbidden, and teach the sons of Israel." By extension, one is not a allowed to render decisions on the matter of law while drunk. However, one is allowed to teach the Talmud.
