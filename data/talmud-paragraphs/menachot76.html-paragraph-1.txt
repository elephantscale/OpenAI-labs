 All flour offerings require three hundred rubbings and five hundred poundings applied to its wheat. Rabbi Yose says that they were applied to the dough. All flour offerings were brought in groups of ten loaves, except for the Breads of Vision, which were brought in groups of twelve, - these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah, who takes the ten loaves from the thanksgiving offering. Rabbi Meir says that they were all made of twelve loaves, except for the thanksgiving offering.
