Sotah 15 - The sacrifice of jealousy A husband who suspects his wife brings a sacrifice different from all other sacrifices. Usual flour offerings use wheat, but this one is made of barley. Regular offerings have oil and frankincense added, but this one is brought without. Why is it he, and not the wife, that brings it? - Because one should not be his or her own accuser. But why does the husband deserve this inferior sacrifice? - The wife is unfaithful when the husband is unfaithful or gives another reason.
