 King Yannai (who killed all members of the Sanhedrin) bequeathed this to his wife: not to be afraid of the Sages' vengeance because they are righteous and will not do wrong, and neither be afraid of the followers of King's Yannai sect, because they esteem her. She should only be scared of false people who pretend to be righteous like Pinchas, but their deeds are licentious as those of Zimri.
