Eruvin 32 - One's dwelling on Shabbat One Shabbat, one has to "stay in his place." This means that he must imagine a circle around his dwelling, with the radius of two thousand amot (about half a mile) and never walk beyond the limit of this circle. A city is considered one's dwelling, so practically one can walk half a mile away from the city, but no more than that.
