 Rabbi Yochanan said that an idolater who engrosses himself in Torah study is liable to death, as it says "Moses commanded us the Torah; it is an inheritance..." But did not Rabbi Meir say that he is rather like a High Priest, because it says about that laws of the Torah "...That a man should keep them and live by them." - any man, even an idolater? - This refers to the seven Noahide laws.
