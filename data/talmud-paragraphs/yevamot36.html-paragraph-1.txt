 However, if later she miscarries and it turns out that the brother did die childless after all - then now the chalitzah would be required. The question arises: does the previously performed chalitzah suffice? Rabbi Yochanan gives a general rule: a chalitzah of a pregnant woman is actually valid because now it transpires that she did need one. Likewise, a yibum performed with a pregnant woman also counts for the future. Why? Should Elijah the Prophet (who knows the future) come and reveal to us that she will miscarry, then the chalitzah would be valid - and therefore, it is valid even now. Alternatively - says Rabbi Yochanan - the proof is from the rule we had learned before, which states that "the marriage can continue." This means that the yibum with the pregnant woman is valid!
