Brachot 12 - The Prayers of the Kohanim The Kohanim, the priests in the Temple, could say only those prayers which superseded their services. They therefore said one, not two, blessings before the Shema. Then they recited the ten commandments, and afterwards the Shema. Then they said the blessing after Shema, because it mentions trust in God. Out of the Amidah (Eighteen blessings) they said the prayer for the acceptance of their services, and then the three-part blessing for the people.
