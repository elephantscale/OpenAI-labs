 The Talmud discusses the other miracles with their particulars, excluding some and adding others to the list. For example, the Bread of Vision remained piping hot after it was left on the Temple table for a week: since the verse literally said, "to put bread, warm, on the day, it (the old one) is taken off," we move the comma and understand that it was "warm on the day it was taken off."
