 All his life Choni was bothered by the phrase, "When we came back from Babylon to rebuild the Temple, we were like dreamers." This exile lasted for seventy years, but can anyone sleep for that long? Once Choni saw a man planting carob trees. The man told him that he was producing for his grandchildren, just as his grandfathers planted for him, for it takes seventy years for a carob to grow. Choni then sat down to eat and fell asleep. When he awoke, he saw a man by the carob tree who told Choni that he was a grandson of the man he had seen earlier. Choni deduced that he had slept for seventy years. He went to the study hall, where he heard the students say, "Today all is clear to us, just like in the days of Choni, the circle maker." He said, "I am Choni." But they did not believe him and did not pay him proper respect. He prayed for mercy and died.
