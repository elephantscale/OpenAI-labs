Shabbat 133 - All necessities of circumcision Circumcision includes removing two layers of skin: the comparatively thick outer layer, called the foreskin, which covers the corona on the outside, and the thin membrane, which covers it on the inside. First the outer foreskin is removed, and then the membrane is pulled back. Then one who performs the circumcision draws the blood - for otherwise the accumulated blood would cause danger - and afterward the dresses up the wound.
