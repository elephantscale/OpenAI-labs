 In the Temple, they said the blessing as one long phrase, without an interruption for "Amen." In the Temple, people, as a rule, did not say Amen, but responded with a longer term; here, this phrase would interrupt the blessing. Moreover, in the Temple, the Priests pronounced the Name of God as it is written, in the form that implies "was, is, and will be." The exact pronunciation of it is not known today.
