 In general, however, one can't establish the right to damaging behavior. For example, if one installs a kiln that emits heavy smoke, he cannot claim to have established a chazakah. The neighbor can protest and block this after any period of time. The same applies to an outhouse, if its odor disturbs the neighbor.
