Zevachim 88 - There is no Place for Poverty in the Place of Opulence An animal sacrifice is sanctified with an oral declaration by the owner, but offerings like wine and flour require being placed in a Temple vessel. Flour Temple vessels were also used for measuring, having the capacity of one issaron (between 11 to 21 cups). The vessels designated for fluids sanctify liquid offering, and those for dry offerings sanctify only dry offerings, but not the liquid ones.
