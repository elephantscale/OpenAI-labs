 The punishment for false measures is more severe than that for illicit relationships. In regard to "..all these..." illicit relationships, a shorter form of "these" - "el" is used, but in regard to false measures, "...all who do these..." a longer form "eleh" is used. Why? One cannot remember all those he has cheated and return money to them.
