Zevachim 3 - He Noted a Contradiction and Resolved It Rava noted another contradiction: Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav that a sin offering slaughtered for the sake of burnt offering is invalid, but if one slaughtered it for the sake of regular, non-sacrificial meat, then it is valid. We see from here that the intent for another offering invalidates the sin offering, but the intent for something that is not an offering at all does not have any adverse effect.
