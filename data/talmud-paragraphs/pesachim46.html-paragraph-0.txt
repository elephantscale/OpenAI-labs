Pesachim 46 - Deaf dough If a batch of dough became "deaf," that is, if there are reasons to suspect that it has leavened (such as if it became white but has not shown surface cracks typical of leavening), then we take another dough that was kneaded in a similar situation and check that one for chametz. If the other dough leavened, we assume that the one in question leavened also. But what if we don't have another dough? Then we assume that the dough leavens in the time it takes one to walk a "mil," or about two thousand steps, which is eighteen minutes. The same eighteen minutes appear in many other laws.
