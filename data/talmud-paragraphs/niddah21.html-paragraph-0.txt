Niddah 21 - Miscarriage When a woman gives birth to a child, she becomes ritually impure for seven days if that child was a male, and for fourteen, if it was a female. However, after this begins her period of purity, and even if she sees blood, this blood is pure. This period lasts for thirty-three days for a male child, and sixty-six for a female. This purity is only in regards to her relations with her husband; in order to go to the Temple, she needs to wait out the complete time above, and then bring a childbirth offering.
