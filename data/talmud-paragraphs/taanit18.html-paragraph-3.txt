 A Greek governor Nikanor would wave every day toward the Temple, saying, "When will it fall into my hands, and I will trample it?" When the Maccabees prevailed, they cut off his thumbs and big toes and hung them at the gates of Jerusalem, saying, "The mouth that said it, the hands that waved and the feet that would trample - let revenge be taken against them." Incidentally, they cut off his head, too.
