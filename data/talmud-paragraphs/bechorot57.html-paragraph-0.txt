Bechorot 57 - Who is Obligated in Animal Tithe When a father dies and brother become heirs to his estate - but until the time that they divide it - they are obligated to give the tithe, because the estate is the real owner. Once they divide it, if they continue to operate it together as partners, they are not obligated to tithe, since no partners are obligated. Incidentally, the law of the "kolbon", a small coin given in addition to the half-shekel to the Temple, is just the opposite.
