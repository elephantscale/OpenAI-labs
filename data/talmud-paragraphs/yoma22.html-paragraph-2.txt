 Why was there no lottery at first? Because the Sages expected that not too many people would rise early enough for this service. They reasoned that it is easier to stay late than to wake up early. Then they established running competition and later a lottery. However, the people stopped coming, saying, "Who knows if I will win the lottery!" So the Sages increased the reward, and the winner would get the removal of the ashes and two more subsequent mitzvot.
