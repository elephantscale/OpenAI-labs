Yoma 67 - Walking with the goat The appointed Kohen, who was taking the goat to the desert cliff, was accompanied by the eminent people of Jerusalem. They could only walk with him on the first leg of the journey, though, because of the "techum" limitation: one cannot walk more than 2,000 steps away from his place of residence on holidays. There were twelve such stretches from Jerusalem to the cliff, with a booth prepared at the end of the first ten, and they accompanied him as far as the first booth.
