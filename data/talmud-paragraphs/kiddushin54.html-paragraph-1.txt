 If one betroths a woman with property belonging to the Temple treasury, then, if he did this by mistake, the property first became his, and even though he committed misappropriation, the betrothal took effect. If, on the other hand, he did it knowingly, then the property remained consecrated, not his, and the betrothal did not work (accepted ruling of Rabbi Yehudah).
