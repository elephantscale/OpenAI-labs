Brachot 6 - Demons Abba Binyamin taught that there are many demons, invisible spiritual agents, and if an eye could see them, no creature would be able to stand in face of them. Abaye added "They outnumber us." Rava said, "The feeling that one is squeezed at a public lecture - it's because of them. The garments of the students who only study and do no hard work, when they wear out fast - it's because of them." If one wants to see their steps, let him take sifted ashes and spread them around his bed, and in the morning he will see marks like the footprints of a rooster. If one wants to see them, he should take a placenta of a female cat, that is a black cat, daughter of black cat, burn it, grind it, and put it in his eyes. He should hide the ashes in lead, and the whole practice is dangerous and not recommended.
