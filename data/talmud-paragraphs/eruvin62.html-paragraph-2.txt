 Rabbi Eliezer ben Yakov adds the the idolater only restricts when there are at least two Jews in the same courtyard, and Rabbi Meir says that even for one Jewish resident it is a problem. What is their disagreement? Rabbi Eliezer is of the opinion that it is unusual for one Jew to live with an idolater, because he would be afraid to be killed - and the Sages never make their decrees for unusual situations. If so, what does Rabbi Meir reply? - He says that occasionally a Jew may be forced to live alone with an idolater, and thus the eruv limitation still applies.
