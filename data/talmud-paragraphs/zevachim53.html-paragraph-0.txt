Zevachim 53 - Communal and Individual Sin-Offerings Here is the law of the individual and communal offerings - which include the communal sin-offering of a goat on New Moon, and on every Festival: their slaughter is in the north of the Altar and the reception of their blood is also in the north. This law is derived with the logic of "general rule": since the Torah told us this law regarding one type of one sin-offering, we can extend it to all other sin-offerings, if there is no indication to the contrary.
