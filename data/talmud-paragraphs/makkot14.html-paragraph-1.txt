 Rabbi Yitzchak says that for relations with his sister one is cut off, but does not get lashes. Talking about the laws of incest, the Torah repeated the prohibition of one's sister. There is a rule, "Exception proves the rule." In our case, when incest with one's sister is prohibited yet again, on the pain of being cut off, this teaches that being cut off is the only punishment for it, and one does not get lashes. It then also teaches that one does not get lashes for all other similar transgressions.
