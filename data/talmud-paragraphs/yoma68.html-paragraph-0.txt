Yoma 68 - Waiting for the goat The High Priest returned to the ox and the goat. They were slaughtered earlier and will later to burned. He took out the sacrificial parts to be burned on the Altar, put them in a golden vessel, and braided the limbs of the two animals together. Other priests took them out to the burning place, carrying them on a pole and dismembering them before burning, not removing the skin. These priests became impure through performing this service.
