 The son of Rav Dimi had a child born to him. Unfortunately, this child died before he was thirty days old, and the rule is that in such a case mourning is not required, because perhaps the child was not viable. However, the son of Rav Dimi sat in mourning. The custom was to serve very tasty food to mourners, to lift up their spirits, and Rav Dimi asked his son, "Do you simply want to eat the tasty morsels that they serve to mourners?" However, Rav Dimi's son answered him, "I know through other means that this was a viable child."
