 The explanation above may sound forced. Another explanation is that we are dealing with the opinion of Rabbi Meir that writing does not matter, only signing by the witnesses does, and it accomplishes the divorce. And they signed after the leaf was torn off the tree. This sounds more natural, why did they give the first explanation at all? - Because of the rule that in divorces the law follow Rabbi Elazar, not Rabbi Meir, so they did not want to ascribe this rule to him.
