Shabbat 138 - Straining wine Rabbi Eliezer is known for allowing to prepare for a mitzvah on Shabbat. Since enjoying wine is a mitzvah, Rabbi Eliezer allows to pour wine into a strainer, if it was set up before Shabbat. Setting it up in the first place would be prohibited though, either because he is building a temporary tent, or because it is too similar to his weekdays activities.
