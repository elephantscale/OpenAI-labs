 Calling the ninth animal "tenth" gave it a degree of holiness, and it can't be slaughtered until it develops a blemish. The owner made a mistake calling the tenth "ninth," but it become tithe through his intent. And, since the word "tenth" was never properly applied, it kept its power and made the eleventh animal a Temple sacrifice. Ninth and eleventh are sanctified because of an extra word "it will be" holy.
