Shekalim 21 - Found spittle When people were able to keep the laws of ritual purity, they were careful if they found spittle, for perhaps it came from someone (a zav) whose spittle would make a person ritually impure. However, in Jerusalem, people kept a higher standard, so spittle found there was considered pure - this is Rabbi Meir's opinion. Rabbi Yose, however, says that this depends on traffic. In the time of the festivals, when ritually pure people occupied the center of the streets, spittle found in the center was pure, but one on the sides - impure. On other days it was the reverse. The Talmud then discusses knives found on the way down to a mikveh, and on the way up from it, at different times and for different types of knives.
