 What is the source for general rule? Rabbi Yochanan said, from the book of Job, "Likewise the night that declared: A man has been conceived" - night is given for conception, but not day. But Resh Lakish derives it from Proverbs, "One who degrades his way..." and "way" is an euphemism for marital relations. According to Resh Lakish, "night that declared" means something different: there is an angel called "Night," or "Laila." That angel takes the drop from which the child will be conceived, places it before the Holy One Blessed is He, and asks, "Master of the Universe! This drop, what is its destiny? Mighty or weak; intelligent or foolish; wealthy or poor?" However, he does not ask, "Wicked or righteous?" This agrees with the lesson that Rav Chanina derived from the phrase, "And now, Israel, what does God want of you? Only that you remain in awe of God your Lord, so that you will follow all His paths..."
