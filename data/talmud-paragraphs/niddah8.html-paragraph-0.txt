Niddah 8 - The Law Follows Rabbi Eliezer in Four Cases Earlier we learned a case where Rabbi Eliezer stated his opinion, but Rabbi Yehoshua disagreed with him. In regard to this, Shmuel said, "The law in general follows Rabbi Eliezer in four cases, and the above is one of them." But in each of these cases, the ruling itself included the words, "And the law is like Rabbi Eliezer." Why did Shmuel have to teach us the obvious? - That is exactly what Shmuel is telling us: just because the earlier ruling (Mishna) states that the law follows a certain Sage, we cannot say that this is necessarily true, since later rulings (Talmud) may change this, or establish it in only a specific limited situation. Thus, we cannot rely on our partial learning, but must have the totality of all the rules in front of us.
