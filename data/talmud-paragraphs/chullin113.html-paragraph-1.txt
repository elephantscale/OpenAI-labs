 Only meat of a kosher animal with the milk of a kosher animal are forbidden. Rabbi Akiva says that the Torah did not prohibit cooking meat of a wild kosher animal or the meat of a fowl with milk, although he agrees that the Sages later prohibited this as well: the Torah repeated the prohibition thrice to exclude from it the meat of wild animals, non-kosher animals, and fowl.
