Sotah 44 - What is there to be afraid of? We mentioned that there was a special one among the exclusions from military service: if someone is afraid of war and cannot face danger, he should go back. Some people are soft-hearted, and they may lead the army to lose its morale, contributing to defeat. This is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
