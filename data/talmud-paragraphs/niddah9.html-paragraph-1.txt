 A pregnant woman has this status when her pregnancy is noticeable. A nursing woman is one who nurses, until she weans the child - these are the words of Rabbi Meir, who says that there is a direct connection between nursing and the abeyance of blood - and therefore it may last even for four or five years. However, the Sages say the the abeyance of blood is the result of having given birth, and lasts no longer than two years.
