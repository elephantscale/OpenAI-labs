Shevuot 19 - Two Types of Oaths That Are Four If one says, "An oath that I will eat" (a certain food object), or "An oath that I will not eat" - these are the two oaths explicit in the Torah. "An oath that I ate," or "An oath that I did not eat" - these are the two types of oath derived by exegesis.
