Brachot 43 - Eating in a company At a common meal, when people are eating as a company, one should recite the blessing for food for all present, and then they can all eat. However, if they are not eating as a group, then each one should recite his own blessing. What is a sign that they are eating together? - When they are sitting together at a table, but not, for example, when they are standing. Another case of eating in a company is when they say, "Let's go an eat at such-and-such place."
