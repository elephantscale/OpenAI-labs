Arachin 20 - Real vs Symbolic Value Sometimes symbolic value of a person is stricter than the real. For example, if he vowed his symbolic value to the Temple but died before paying, his heirs must give it: since the symbolic obligation is fixed by the Torah, it exists from the moment he vows. By contrast, if he promised his real value (as defined by being sold on the slave market), and died before he was appraised, his heirs need not give anything, since dead have no monetary value.
