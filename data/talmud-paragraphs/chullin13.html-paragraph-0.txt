Chullin 13 - Shechitah Does Not Require Intent From the fact that a minor can do shechitah we see that intent is not required for it - as opposed to the slaughter of sacrifices. Indeed, we learned that if one threw a knife to plunge it into the wall, and as the knife went in flight, it slaughtered the animal in a proper way, Rabbi Nathan says that it is a valid shechitah. But, for a short knife one needs to move his knife back and forth!? - In this case also, the knife rebounded from the wall and completed the slaughter.
