Niddah 23 - Animal If a woman aborts something resembling a fish, a locust, or a rodent, this is not considered birth, and she is ritually pure, if there was no blood. If she aborts something resembling domesticated animal, wild animal, or fowl, then Rabbi Meir says that she observes the waiting periods as if she gave birth to a human, but the Sages say that only a human-like form considered birth for the purposes of ritual purity.
