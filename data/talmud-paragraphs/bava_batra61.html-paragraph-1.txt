 If one sells a house without specifying what is included in the sale, he has not sold the annex, even it opens into the house. Nor has he sold a storeroom in the rear of the house. Such closets served as a storage area for valuables and did not function as part of the living area of the house. Neither has he sold the rooftop if it has a parapet around it at least ten hand-breads high.
