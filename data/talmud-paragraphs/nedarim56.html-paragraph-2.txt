 Ulla said that this was a bed of good fortune. It was customary to designate a bed for a good angel protecting the home to elicit good luck for the house. Since this "dargash" is mentioned in many other rules, the Talmud argues that it could not be the good fortune bed and that dargash means a bed with a leather interior and loops in which the ropes were tied and could be untied. So the bed of good fortune is not disproved, but it must go under a different name.
