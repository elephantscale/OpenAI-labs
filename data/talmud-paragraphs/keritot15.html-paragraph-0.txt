Keritot 15 - Questions That Rabbi Akiva Asked Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua went to the meat market of Ema'um, to buy an animal for the wedding feast of Rabban Gamliel's son. Rabbi Akiva met them there and involved them in a discussion. He asked, "If a man inadvertently cohabits with his sister, who is also his father's sister and his mother's sister, what is the law? Does he have to bring only one sacrifice, since it is only one woman, or does he have to bring three, since these are three different prohibitions?" They answers, "We have not heard an explicit decision on this, but we know a similar case. If one cohabits with his five wives who all did not go to a mikva, he needs to bring five sin-offerings. It seems to us that your case can be deduced with a fortiori logic."
