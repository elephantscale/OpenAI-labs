 The Sages say that a woman may show her tooth to her companions, then forget and carry it. Rabbi Yehudah says that this is not such an outstanding show-and-tell item. Alternatively, the Sages' concern is that people will ridicule her, and she will take it out, and then carry. Again, Rabbi Yehudah, in this explanation, does not consider a golden tooth to be an object of ridicule. None of these reasons apply to a silver tooth, and certainly to a naturally-looking tooth.
