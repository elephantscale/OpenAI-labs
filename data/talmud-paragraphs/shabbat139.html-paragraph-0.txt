Shabbat 139 - Stricter laws for the ignorant Rabbi Yose ben Elisha says, "If you see a generation upon which many troubles come - go and examine the deeds of the judges in the Jewish courts, because troubles come to the world only on account of corrupt judges, who use their influence for their own benefit. Ulla said, "Redemption will come to Israel through charity, following Isaiah: 'Zion will be redeemed through justice and its people through charity.'"
