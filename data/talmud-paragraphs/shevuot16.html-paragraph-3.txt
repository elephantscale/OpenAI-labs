 If one became impure while in the Temple and forgot about it, he is obligated to bring a "variable" offering. This is not mentioned directly in the Torah. However, since there are two separate prohibitions to enter the Tabernacle and the Temple while being impure, and the words Tabernacle and Temple are used interchangeably, the extra prohibition is applied to one who becomes impure while in the Courtyard.
