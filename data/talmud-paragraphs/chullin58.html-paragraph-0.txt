Chullin 58 - Can Terefah Live? There was a man in Einbul whose skull was missing a piece as large as a drill hole, but they fashioned for him a piece of dried gourd shell and he lived. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said, "That's no proof! It occurred in the summertime, but once the cold season came upon him, he died" - because in Rabbi Shimon's view a terefah cannot survive for more than a year. The final law is that once an animal survived for twelve months, it is not a terefah. Also, if it is a female and gave birth, it is not a terefah.
