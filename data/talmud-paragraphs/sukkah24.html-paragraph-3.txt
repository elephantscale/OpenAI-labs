 So you are saying that you are concerned about the animal's death, but otherwise, the animal could be a wall? If so, it is a utensil and can receive spiritual impurity. Why then does Rabbi Meir consider it pure even when used as a coffin cover? Because of this objection, we take away all of the previous discussion and say that the real reason why an animal cannot be a wall is that Rabbi Meir requires walls made by man's hands in a sukkah.
