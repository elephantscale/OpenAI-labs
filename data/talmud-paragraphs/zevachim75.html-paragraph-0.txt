Zevachim 75 - Mixing Wine vs. Mixing Animals Rabbi Elazar gave the following rule: If a sealed cask of the kohen's tithe wine became intermingled with a hundred casks of ordinary wine, one can open a cask (making it insignificant and subject to nullification), take out one-hundredth (for otherwise he would be stealing from the Kohanim to whom the tithe belongs), and then drink the rest of the wine in that cask.
