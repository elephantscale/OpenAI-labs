Niddah 36 - Not Every Blood Makes Woman a Niddah Not every blood that a woman sees makes her a niddah. In fact, she can become a niddah only in the first seven days of her cycle. Then she can go into a mikveh and be again permitted to her husband. After that begin the eleven days when blood gives her a different status, "zavah". These 7 + 11 day cycles are described here for reference. Today the law is more strict, and she waits for seven days after any blood.
