 Rami bar Chama asked a question, if an elephant swallowed palm fiber which emerged intact from its digestive tract, and someone made them into a basket, is the fiber considered digested and therefore the basket is immune to ritual impurity? Consider the case of wolves who swallowed two infants in Transjordan, and then excreted them whole, and the Sages declared the meat digested and therefore pure! - No, it is not the same, the meat is softer than fiber. But the bones the Sages declared impure! - No proof, since the bones are harder. Thus, no answer.
