 A servant of Rabbi Levi used to re-sell food products and was considered trustworthy. After Rabbi Levi died, Rabbi Yochanan said, "A servant of a trustworthy person remains trustworthy even after the master's death - unless proven otherwise." In the same way the wife of a trustworthy person is just as trustworthy as her husband.
