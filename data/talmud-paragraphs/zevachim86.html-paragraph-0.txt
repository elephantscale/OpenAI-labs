Zevachim 86 - Limbs That Fell off the Altar Due to the heat on the Altar's pyre, some parts may burst off, and today's question is: should they be returned? All the parts they were included in the rule of "once they are on the Altar, they should not be removed," if they fall off, need not be returned - but it is merely allowed to do so. Similarly, the embers, if they fell off the Altar, need not be returned, but if they did not completely fall off the Altar, they must be returned to the pyre.
