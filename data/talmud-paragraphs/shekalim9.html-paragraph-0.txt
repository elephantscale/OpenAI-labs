Shekalim 9 - Scooping three times There was a procedure to the scooping: the priest would go into the chamber and call from there, "Should I scoop?" and the administrators would command him three times: "Scoop! Scoop! Scoop!" He would fill the first box and cover the money remaining in this part of the room with a hide; he would then fill the second box and again cover the remainder with a hide, and the third portion he would not cover. Why all this? The first portion was of the people of Israel, the second - for the surrounding cities, and the third - for the people of Babylon, Media, and far away lands.
