Zevachim 67 - Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer Argue About a Bird Burnt-Offering If a Kohen took a bird that was sanctified by its owner as a burnt-offering and proceeded to bring it as a sin offering, then Rabbi Eliezer says that one commits misappropriation if he misuses it, but Rabbi Yehoshua says that misappropriation is not committed.
