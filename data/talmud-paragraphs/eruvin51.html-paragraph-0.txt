Eruvin 51 - Is the residence area (techum) round or square? Rabbah and Rav Yosef were traveling on the road late Friday afternoon, and they were concerned about their residence area for Shabbat. Rabbah said to Rav Yosef, "Let our Shabbat residence be established under that tree (he knew it) that produces so much fruit that it relieves its owner of paying taxes." Rav Yosef countered, "But I don't know it." Rabbah then quoted in the name of Rabbi Yose, "One who does not know the place can rely on the other one who does." That was not actually true, the rule was not in the name of Rabbi Yose, but Rabbah attributed it to him on purpose, so that Rav Yosef (who was blind) would accept its authority, since Rabbi Yose is known for deep reasoning behind his rulings.
