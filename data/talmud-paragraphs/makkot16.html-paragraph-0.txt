Makkot 16 - Remedy for Transgression "You shall not leave from the Passover offering until morning, and whatever is left until morning you shall burn with fire" - is an example of a remedy for one's transgression. In this case one is not punished with lashes. Rabbi Yochanan learns from here that had the Torah not provided the remedy, he would be punished, even though this is an example of an uncertain warning. Thus, one can get lashes with uncertain warning. Resh Lakish learns that had the Torah not provided the remedy, he would be punished, even though the transgression of leaving over involves no action. Thus, one can incur lashes for the prohibition that does not involve action.
