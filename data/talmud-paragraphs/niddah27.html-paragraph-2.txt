 Rabbi Yose ben Shaul asked, "If a woman aborts a fetus in the shape of a raven, and an afterbirth after that, do we attribute the afterbirth to the raven-shaped fetus? Rabbi Yehudah the Prince answered, "No, since ravens don't have afterbirth, we do not attribute it." Rabbi Yose continued, "But what if the afterbirth is attached to it?" Rabbi Yehudah said, "It is impossible." However, he was proven wrong by a teaching that considered just such a case.
