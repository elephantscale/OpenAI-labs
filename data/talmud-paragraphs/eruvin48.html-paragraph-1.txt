 What about objects (say, sheep) that were brought to a market by a non-Jews from a distance greater than two thousands steps? Some say that they are like ownerless objects, and a Jew may buy and use them on a Festival (of course, not by paying money, but but promising to pay later). Others say that they have the same law as Jewish objects - for without this law the Jews also may eventually forget the techum limitations.
