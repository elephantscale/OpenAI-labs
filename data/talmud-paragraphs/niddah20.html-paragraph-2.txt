 Ifra Hurmiz, the mother of the Persian king Shapur, observed the laws of niddah. She once sent her blood to Rava, who said, "It is the blood of desire, and it is not like other bloods, but it is pure." (Some say, it is impure, and Rava was demonstrating his deep knowledge.) She said to her son, "Look how wise Jews are!" He said, "Maybe he just stumbled upon the answer." She then sent Rava sixty types of blood, and he identified them all, except for the last one, the blood of a louse. He had help from Above though, since together with his answers he sent her a fancy comb used to kill lice. She exclaimed, "Jews, you dwell in the chambers of the heart!"
