 Philosophers asked the Jewish Sages in Rome, "If God is not favorably disposed toward an idol, why does He not simply get rid of it?" The Sages answers, "If people worshipped something that the world does not need, God would indeed get rid if it. But behold, they worship the sun, the moon, the stars - should God destroy the world because of fools?"
