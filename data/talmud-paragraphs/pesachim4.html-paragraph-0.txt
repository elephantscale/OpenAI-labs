Pesachim 4 - Why search for chametz so early? Now that all agree that the "light" of the search for chametz means night, it is fair to ask, why must it be done so early? Even if we are rushing to do a mitzvah, we don't find anywhere that it should happen the night prior. Since chametz will be prohibited only from the middle of the next day, we could require the search to be done early in the morning.
