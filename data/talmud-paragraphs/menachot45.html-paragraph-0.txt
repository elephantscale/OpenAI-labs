Menachot 45 - The Book of Ezekiel The book of Ezekiel contains apparent contradictions to the Torah. It would have been concealed, if not for Chanina ben Chizkiyah who who brought 300 barrels of oil up to his upper chamber and worked there until he explained all the difficult verses. For example, it says, "Any animal that was not properly slaughtered or that was sick the priests should not eat." Are we to understand that regular Jews are allowed this? - No! Rather, the kohanim, since they eat birds slaughtered by melikah, may be thought to be allowed to eat other non-kosher meat, and Ezekiel prohibits that.
