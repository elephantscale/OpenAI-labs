 He would say, "Please, the Name, I have sinned willfully, rebelliously and inadvertently. Please, the Name, please grant atonement for the willful, rebellious and inadvertent sins - that I have committed before you, I and my household." Then he would quote from the Torah where the promise of forgiveness was given. The people who listened would prostrate and say, "Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingship, forever and ever."
