Kiddushin 53 - Betrothal with a Priest's Portion of Sacrifices If a priest betroths a woman with his portion of the sacrificial offering, whether most-holy (such as burnt-offering and sin-offering) or an offering of lesser holiness (such as peace offering and thanks-offering), she is not betrothed. The portions allotted to the priest and the owner of the offering are not theirs, but rather Divine property which they are merely permitted to eat.
