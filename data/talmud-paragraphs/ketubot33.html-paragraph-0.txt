Ketubot 33 - Which is worse, torture or death? Continuing with the subject of money penalty vs. lashes, imagine that two witnesses testify about their fellow that he owes money to someone, and later it transpires that they were scheming false witnesses. On the one hand, they should repay the money which the subject of their testimony would otherwise have lost since the Torah said, "do to them what they schemed to do to their fellow." On the other hand, they transgressed a very serious prohibition of being false witnesses and perhaps should be given lashes, like for any prohibition on the Torah. Which should apply?
