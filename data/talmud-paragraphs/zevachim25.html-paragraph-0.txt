Zevachim 25 - Receiving the Blood of the Sacrifice The phrase "The anointed Kohen shall take from the blood of the bull" teaches that the kohen must receive from the lifeblood, and not from the blood of the skin, nor from the remnant blood. The term "the bull" implies that the blood of the very essence of the bull, that is, its lifeblood, should be received.
