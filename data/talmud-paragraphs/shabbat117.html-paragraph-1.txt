 One is also allowed to save food, both for humans and for animals. However, one can only save enough for Shabbat: for example, if the fire broke out of Friday evening, he can save the amount necessary for three meals, but if it started on Shabbat morning, he can only save two meals. Rabbi Yose allows to save three meals under all circumstances, because in his opinion the law is already strict enough, and there is not need to count meals.
