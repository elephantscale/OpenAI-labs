 The word "extends" can be spelled with an aleph (מאברין), meaning "a limb," or with an ayin (מעברין), meaning "pregnant". Rav holds one view on this, while Shmuel - the other. The Talmud lists other differences between Rav and Shmuel: (a) was the "new king of Egypt" really new, or did he just take new measures to oppress the Jews; (b) was the grave of the patriarchs called "double" (machpelah) because it had two stories or because it had multiple couples buried there, and (c) was Nimrod the real name of the king and was he called Amraphel (which means "said and threw") because he commanded to throw Abraham into the fire, or was his real name Amraphel, and he was called Nimrod (rebel) because he caused people to rebel against God.
