 Beit Shammai said to Beit Hillel, "Why is the eleventh day different?" Beit Hillel answered, "Because the flow on the next day would be that of niddah, not zivah, and not combined with this day." Beit Shammai continued, "But you do give her some of the ritual impurity laws! So the eleventh day is the same as the ten days before!?" Beit Hillel answered, "We talk only about the impurity decreed by the Sages, but not an actual sacrifice obligation because you can't bring it on your own, without the Torah telling you."
