 In the final analysis, charity and just deeds are better than the sacrifices and the money (shekalim) used for the sacrifices. People used to taunt King David, going next to his windows and asking, "When will the Temple be built?" - because it was known that it can be built only after King David's death. However, David would say, "Even though they want to anger me, I am happy with their words. I, too, would give up my life to build the Temple." And nevertheless, God would say, "I will make your life complete, because one day of your life, David, with your charity and just deeds, are more precious to Me than the future sacrifices."
