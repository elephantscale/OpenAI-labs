 When blood is let from an animal, it drips slowly at first, until, after a few drops, it begins to spurt. The initial spurt is bright, but as the blood continues to flow, it slows and darkens in color. Only this is called the "blood of its kill," when the animal dies. Rabbi Yehudah considers the complete act of slaughter as shechitah, with the "blood of its kill" being part of it, whereas Rabbi Chiya only considers the final moment as shechitah, thus at each stage it is only a doubt if a valid shechitah will result.
