 Another allusion: the Torah writes, "When a man dies in a tent... all utensils under the tent will be impure." Rabbi Yochanan explained, this teaches that a man should never leave the tent of study, until the day of his death. Resh Lakish said, "Moreover, he will remember his learning only if he literally kills himself for its sake" - just as the Torah said, "When a man dies in a tent".
