Menachot 32 - How to Write a Mezuzah The last words of the mezuzah - "on the earth" - must appear alone on the line. Some take it to mean at the end of the line, so that "heaven" appears directly over "earth," to indicate that your days be prolonged like the height of heaven over the earth. Others say that it means at the beginning of the line, so that "earth" is as far as possible away from "heaven," to indicate that the days of your life be prolonged like the heaven is far from the earth.
