Eruvin 39 - Making conditions Rosh HaShanah - New Year - is celebrated for two days. Even though the Torah, of course, decreed only one day of Rosh HaShanah, practically it was very hard to know when this day occurs - on the last day of the previous month, or the first day of the next one. So as not to do work on Rosh HaShana by mistake, people abstained from work on the first possible day of Rosh HaShana, and then also on the second.
