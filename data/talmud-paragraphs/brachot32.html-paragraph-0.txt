Brachot 32 - Flinging words upward toward Heaven Hannah flung words upward toward Heaven, that is, she spoke insolently to God. She said (in the book of Samuel), "Give me a child! If You do not, I will hide myself with another man and cause my husband Elkanah to become jealous of me and to warn against that man. I will then hide with him again, be tested with bitter waters, and, since I will be innocent, You will be forced to fulfill the words of Your Torah, 'then she shall be proven innocent and she shall bear seed.'"
