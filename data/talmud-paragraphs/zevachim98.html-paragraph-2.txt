 If a kohen became ritually impure and went to the mikveh to dip in order to purify himself, he still needs to wait for sun to go down, after which he becomes completely pure and can eat sacrifices. During that day he is still partially impure, and has no claim to the sacrifices slaughtered on that day, even though he will be fit to eat them in the evening. The same is true for a kohen who needs to offer additional sacrifices for his purification - he cannot take a raincheck to apply it in the evening.
