Eruvin 80 - Food in an alley In addition to collecting food from all residents in each courtyard, the different courtyards in an alley have to collect food for the common "alley eruv," in order to allow carrying on Shabbat between courtyards. Practically, however, it may be too burdensome, so instead one can act as follows: he takes a barrel of his own food and declares, "Let this belong to all the residents of the alley." The declaration alone won't suffice though, since in every transaction there must be a recipient. Therefore, he asks someone independent of him, even a servant, but not a dependent child, to acquire the barrel on their behalf.
