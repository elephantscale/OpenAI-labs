 One who sells a donkey has sold its foal, but if one sold a cow, he has not sold its calf. If one sold a dump, he has sold its manure. If one sold a pit, he has sold its waters. If one sold a beehive, he has sold the bees. If one sold a dovecote, he has sold the doves. In all these cases, the contents are considered subsidiary to and are sold along with the primary item that contains them.
