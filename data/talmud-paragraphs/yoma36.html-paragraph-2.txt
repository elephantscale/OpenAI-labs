 What was this Name? Some say it is was the four letter name of God, the Tetragrammaton, that the Torah commanded to conceal and that is commonly pronounced instead as "Adonai", or my Master. Others say that the name that the High Priest pronounced was completely different from what we have in our texts, and that it was a secret name of forty-two letters. One of the reasons for concealment was the power that the name could give to the wrong person.
