 On the subject of Altars, Rabbi Abahu gives proof that the Torah Sages are not subject to the fire of Gehinnom, as follows. A salamander (which is created in a fire burning for seven years) is an offspring of fire, and yet a man who smears himself with its blood becomes immune to fire - then how much more so are the Sages, whose body itself is fire! - following the phase, "Here, my words are like fire, says God."
