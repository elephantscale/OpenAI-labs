Temurah 28 - Forbidden Animal Mix-Up Some animals are forbidden to be offered on the Altar, and if they are mixed up with permitted animals, they forbid the whole herd, even hundreds and thousands, for the Altar. These include one that sodomized a person or one that was sodomized, one that was designated for idolatrous purposes or actually worshipped, one given to a prostitute as a payment, one exchanged for a dog, a hybrid, a sick animal (terefah), and one born of Caesarean section.
