Menachot 84 - Where Did the Grain Come From All flour offerings can be brought from any grain, whether from the new or old crop, grown in the Land of Israel or outside, except for the Omer, which is called "the beginning of your harvest" and the two loaves of Shavuot, which are called a "new flour offering," for the last two have to be brought from the new crop, grown in the Land of Israel.
