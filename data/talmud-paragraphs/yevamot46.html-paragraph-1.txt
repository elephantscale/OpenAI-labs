 Rabbi Yehoshua says just the opposite: immersion in a mikvah is the only requirement since this is all that Jewish women did when they went out of Egypt. Obviously, they could not be circumcised, but how do we know they went to the mikvah? If not that, how were they brought into the Divine presence? But, since a woman can't be circumcised, how can we learn from that law for a man? Rabbi Yehoshua says that we indeed can.
