 "...whether it gores a boy or it gores a girl..." Wouldn't I know it by logic: a man is liable for killing a man, whether adult or minor, and an ox is liable for killing a man - must be, whether adult of minor? No, man's law is more strict, with liability for pain, cure, etc. Therefore, the verse is needed.
