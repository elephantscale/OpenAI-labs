Zevachim 35 - Temporary Rejection If a person whose service is invalid nevertheless takes a small part in it, the service can still be rectified, continuing with the people fit for service. But why should this be possible? We have a principle that a sacrifice that has become temporarily rejected is rejected forever. For example, if on Yom Kippur one of the two goats died, the second one can never be re-used, even after we bring another goat.
