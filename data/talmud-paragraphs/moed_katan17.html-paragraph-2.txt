 After Rav Yehudah's death, the man came to rescind the excommunication. However, Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani, who for years has not visited the assembly, happened to come on this day and said, "How can we do it, seeing that Rav Yehudah did not make peace with him? Why, even a maidservant of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince - when she excommunicated someone, the Sages observed this for three years!" The excommunicated man left the study hall, and a bee bit him on his male organ, and he died. The burial cave of the pious did not accept him, but that of the judges - did. Why did it? - Because he would change his dress and go to faraway places when transgressing so that people would not see him misbehave openly.
