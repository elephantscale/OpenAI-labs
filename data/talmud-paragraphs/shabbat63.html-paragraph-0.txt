Shabbat 63 - Weapons On Shabbat, a man may not go out into a public area with his sword, bow, shield, club, or spear, and if he did, he needs to bring a sacrifice. Rabbi Eliezer says, "These are his ornaments," since they enhance his appearance. However, the Sages, who forbid it, say that it is nothing but a disgrace, following the Isaiah that "They will beat their swords into plowshares."
