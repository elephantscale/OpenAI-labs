Bechorot 7 - Why Is Milk Kosher? The rule that "whatever comes from kosher is kosher" includes milk. But how do we know that milk is allowed for consumption, given that other parts taken from a live animal are forbidden? Is it because mixture of meat and milk is forbidden, and therefore milk must be permitted? - No, it might be permitted only for benefit. Is it because of Solomon's words "Let the milk of goats be sufficient for your food..." - perhaps that, too, is only to sell it and buy food. Rather, it is because David brought for his brothers cheese made from milk. And if you say there too that he wanted them to sell it - is war the time for trade? Alternatively, it is because Israel is praised as land flowing with milk.
