Shabbat 25 - The delights of Shabbat If Friday is a Yov Tov, such as Pesach, Shavuot, or Sukkot, one should not use the oil that is designated for burning for Shabbat lights. What is this oil designated for burning and why one can't use it? It is oil of terumah, or kohen's portion, which must be kept in ritual purity, but which has become ritually impure. Such oil cannot be used for food and must be burned. Why then not use it for Shabbat? - Because the Torah told not to burn such oil on a Yom Tov.
