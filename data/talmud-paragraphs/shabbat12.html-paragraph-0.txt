Shabbat 12 - Work that is not needed Earlier we saw that on Friday afternoon a tailor should not go into the street with his needle, because he may forget and continue carrying it after sundown, when Shabbat already started. However, in discussing the case of a zav (a man who had a gonorrheal discharge), we find one ruling that allows him to carry a pouch to collect his discharge, while the other one forbids it. How are we to understand the opinion that it is allowed? The answer is that only that labor that is needed is prohibited on Shabbat. However, this man needs not his pouch but what collects in it (so that he can know when he becomes ritually pure), and that carrying is permitted - this is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
