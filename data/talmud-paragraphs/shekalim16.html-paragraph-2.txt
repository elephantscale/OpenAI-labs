 The Talmud described various theories where the Ark was hidden and whether it was taken away to Babylon or not. Some say that there were two Arks, one permanent in the Temple and the other one taken to wars. In contrast, others maintain that there was only one Ark. It also describes the various opinions on the size of the Ark and the position of the whole and broken Tablets inside of it.
