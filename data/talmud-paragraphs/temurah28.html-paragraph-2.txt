 That is the rule, but we already learned a very similar rule a while back, in Zevachim! There, if any of the five types of sin offerings that are not needed mixed with other animals, this makes the whole herd prohibited. Why is it repeated? Because in Zevachim all the mixed-in sacrifices were forbidden for benefit, so you might have thought that the ones above, who are permitted to regular use, don't prohibit the herd - the teacher had to tell us that they do.
