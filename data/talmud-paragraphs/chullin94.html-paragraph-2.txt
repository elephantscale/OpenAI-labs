 Another reason that a cut-up thigh may not be sent is that a Jew would then be deceiving an idolater, who would think that he got a super kosher piece of meat, and deceiving any person (literally, "stealing his mind") is prohibited. One should not accustom himself to sleekness and enticement, and even one deceiving or misleading word is not allowed.
