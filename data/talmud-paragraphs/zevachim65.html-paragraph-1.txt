 The word "Kohen" teaches that only a Kohen can do the killing of the bird (melikah). For you might think that since for animal offerings anybody can do the slaughter, it should also be true for birds - the word "Kohen" dispels this notion. Rabbi Akiva says, "Would it enter your mind that a non-Kohen can approach the Altar? Rather, you might think that the melikah is done with the knife. The word 'Kohen' teaches that it has to be done with the very body of the Kohen, that is, with his nail."
