 If a litigant declared to his opponent, "My father is acceptable to me to act as a judge," or "Your father is acceptable to me to act as a judge," or "Three cattle herders are acceptable to me to act as judges," but afterwards changes his mind and wants to retract, then Rabbi Meir says that indeed he may retract, but the Sages say that he may not.
