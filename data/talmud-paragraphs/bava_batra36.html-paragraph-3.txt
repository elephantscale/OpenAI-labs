 Rav Ashi said, "I asked all the great scholars of the generation, and they said to me that plowing establishes chazakah." Rav Nachman bar Yitzhak answered, "Is it proper to rule based on a poll? There are others who don't think this way." And the final decision is that plowing does not establish chazakah.
