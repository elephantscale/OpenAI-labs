 Is it because he follows the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, who obligates one for any prohibited food for even a minute amount? If so, Rabbi Akiva should disagree in general and say to the Sages, "I obligate for any food violation, regardless of amount!" No, this idea is incorrect. Rabbi Akiva could simply be answering the Sages according to their words: "I say, one is liable for any amount of forbidden food. You, the Sages, who don't hold so, should at least agree with me in the instance of an oath, where he violates his oath, not just the food prohibition."
