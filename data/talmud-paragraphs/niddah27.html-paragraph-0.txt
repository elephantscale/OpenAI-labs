Niddah 27 - Afterbirth That Came Later After Rav's death, his student Rav Yehudah and his other students went to study with Shmuel, and were telling him the statements of Rav. Rav Yehudah said, "For the first three days after the birth of a child, the emergence of an afterbirth is attributed to that child that was born. There is no concern for another child that might have dissolved, and no ritual impurity associated with it - nor any special laws for the woman. After three days, we must be concerned with the possibility that there was another child.
