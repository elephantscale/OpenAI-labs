 One should not send presents to a friend on a Yom Tov, since people might see them and think that he is sending goods to the market to sell. The only things that are allowed are ready-made portions of food. This is the opinion of Beit Shammai. However, Beit Hillel is not concerned about it. They allow sending animals and fowl, alive or slaughtered, wines, oils, and fine flours - provided that it is not carried by a caravan of three people, because then it looks like trading.
