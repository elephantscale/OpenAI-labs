 If one of them died, then if it died before the High Priest drew the lots, they simply buy another one. However, if it dies after the lot was drawn, they bring a completely new pair and draw new lots. Now, since the first one was already consecrated, the High Priest stipulates as follows. If the one designated for God died, he says that the new goat designated for God will take its place, but the second one in the newly brought pair will not be needed, so it will go to graze until it dies of old age. Conversely, if the one designated for Azazel died, then the new one on which the lot for Azazel falls will be in his place, and the other one will go to graze.
