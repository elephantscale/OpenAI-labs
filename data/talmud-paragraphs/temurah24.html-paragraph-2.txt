 A loophole to circumvent Kohen's rights in a firstborn animal: if one has in his flock an animal that is pregnant with her first offspring, he can says, "If it is pregnant with a male, let this male be consecrated as a burned offering." There are also further combinations of his statements and possible multiple births of offspring of different genders.
