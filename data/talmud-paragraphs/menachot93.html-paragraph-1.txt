 There are also categories of people who can bring a sacrifice without leaning altogether, and these include a non-Jew, a slave, an agent, and a woman. The agent of a person cannot perform leaning, because it says "your hand" - and not your agent's hand. A woman is not required to lean on her sacrifice because the Torah said "sons of Israel," to exclude "daughters of Israel" from the requirement of leaning.
