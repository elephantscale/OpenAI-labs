Taanit 4 - Three improper requests Since we spoke about rain and seeds, Rava said a related thing: "Young Sages are like a seed under a clod of the earth: he hides and grows, but when he is out, his power only increases." He also said, "When a Sage gets angry, it is the Torah that is burning in him, since God says, 'Is not My word like fire?'" In addition, the Sage must be hard as iron. The Talmud gives two proofs for that. And yet, a person must train himself to always remain calm and "remove anger from his heart."
