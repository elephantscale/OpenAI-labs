 Why can't we purify utensils - they are very much needed! - Because one may come to carry them on Shabbat. Good, but if so, purifying them in one's own courtyard should be permitted! - No, that is an additional precaution, lest one comes to carry in the street. But do we ever make such additional decrees? Talmud tries to prove that we don't but refutes all such proofs. Another explanation: it is prohibited to purify utensils as a precaution against wringing them. What about non-cloth? - Again, additional decree protecting the first one. Again, we go through the proof that such decrees exist.
