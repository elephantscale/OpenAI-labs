 Sancheiriv understood the prophecy of Isaiah as referring to him conquering Jerusalem. His army then made a ten-day journey in one day. When Sancheiriv reached Jerusalem, they built an observation platform for him, and he was amazed how small the city was, compared to the ones he had previously conquered. He told his soldiers to go to sleep, rest, and be ready to take the walls of Jerusalem apart on the morning. During the night, the angel of God came and burned the soldiers.
