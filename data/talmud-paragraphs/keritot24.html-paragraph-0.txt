Keritot 24 - Offering Of Uncertainty - When There Is No Uncertainty Anymore If one was bringing an offering of uncertainty, and meanwhile it was discovered that he did not sin - the animal goes out and grazes with the flock - so says Rabbi Meir. We can understand that: his consecration was in error and is now annulled. However, the Sages say that the animal is a sacrifice, and has to be redeemed once it gets a blemish: since the owner of the sacrifice was worried about his transgression, his sacrifice was brought because of his worry, not because of a certain transgression, and thus the animal is indeed a sacrifice. Now he doesn't need the sacrifice - but the redemption is still required.
