 The roofs are not surrounded by walls, or partitions, they are just flat roofs on top of the houses, so how could any roof be considered a private area where it is permitted to carry? We see here a new principle, "extend the wall:" the walls of the houses that go down can be extended up and serve as imaginary partitions surrounding the roof. We understand now why it can be permitted to carry on the large roof.
