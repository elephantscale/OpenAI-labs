 A man told Resh Lakish about another man: "I know that he is a Kohen because he was always called first to read from the Torah." Resh Lakish answered, "Did you also see him receive terumah?" Rabbi Elazar objected, "And if there were no granaries there, you would not have any Kohanim," but Resh Lakish did not accept it.
