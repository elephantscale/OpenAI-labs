Avodah Zarah 41 - Statues One is prohibited to benefit from an object that was used, even once, for idol worship. What is one to do with images whose history - whether they were used for idolatry or served as ornamentations - is not known? According to Rabbi Meir, all images are prohibited, because they are worshipped at least once a year on a specific date. But the Sages say that all images are permitted, except one that has in its hand a staff, a bird, or a sphere.
