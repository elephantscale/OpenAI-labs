 Those types of work that are only prohibited by the Sages and are too far removed from actual Shabbat violation can be done at twilight - such as, for example, wrapping the food to keep it warm. Why would wrapping not be allowed on Shabbat itself? Because one might find that the dish has cooled off somewhat, and warm it before wrapping, and that would be the prohibited labor of cooking. If so, we should not permit it even during twilight!? - No, during twilight all dishes are piping hot, so he will not warm them up.
