Shevuot 28 - Repeated Oaths and Quizzes If one swore, "I take an oath not to eat this loaf of bread," then again, "I will not eat it," "I will not eat it," and ate, he is liable only for transgressing the first oath. Additional ones do not take effect, since the first one already prohibited the loaf to him. If, however, the first oath is annulled, the second one takes effect.
