Menachot 92 - Leaning on the Sacrifice Most private offering required leaning, or "semichah," when the owner of the sacrifice placed both his hands upon the sacrifice's head and pressed down with all his weight, before the sacrifice was slaughtered. If it was a sin-offering, he confessed his sin, and if it was a thanksgiving offering, he offered thanks to God.
