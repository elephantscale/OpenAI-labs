 Why does there have to be a New Year for the Holidays (Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot)? - for promises. If someone promises a sacrifice, he needs to bring it within the following three Holidays, but he starts counting not from the day of the promise but from Nisan. In an extreme case, therefore, if he promises the sacrifice before Shavuot, he has five Holidays to bring it: Shavuot, Sukkot, Pesach, next Shavuot, next Sukkot.
