Bava Kamma 109 - Son Robs His Father and Swears that He Didn't If one robs his father and swore falsely to him in denial of the robbery, and the father dies, and the son then admits his guilt - he pays the principal and the one-fifth surcharge (for false oath) to his father's other sons or to the father's brothers - who are the next in line to inherit.
