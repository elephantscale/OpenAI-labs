 Who are those unique individuals? - These are the Sages, but for this purpose, anybody can deem himself a Sage since it only brings suffering for him, and not any honor. Furthermore, if one fasts expecting that his fasting will remove particular trouble, and the crisis indeed goes away, he still needs to complete his fast. One should not separate himself from the community in bad times, hoping that it will be good for him individually, but instead, suffer together with all - and then he will be privileged to see the deliverance.
