 In connection with this, there was a commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe. The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the Land of Israel. It was applicable only to a woman who could potentially inherit land at the time of marriage - that is, if she had no brothers and was thus her father's prospective heir.
