 Any kind of food can be used for the eruv, except for water and salt - since they do not properly nourish. Incidentally, one who vowed to abstain for nourishment can still drink water and eat salt. The food does not have to be edible by the owner, as long as others can eat it. For example, one can make an eruv of wine for a nazirite: even though he is prohibited to drink wine, others can. Similarly, one can make eruv of terumah (Kohen's portion) for a regular Jew: even though he cannot eat it, but a Kohen can.
