 Rav Chama asked a related question, "If one uses an idol that is assembled from parts, does it still convey impurity when disassembled? When a layman can reassemble the idol," - he added - "I don't even need to ask, since this is considered as if it was intact. My only question is when only an expert can reassemble it. Do we say that this is better than a broken one, and the impurity is back, or do we say that right now the idol is unusable, and it conveys no impurity?"
