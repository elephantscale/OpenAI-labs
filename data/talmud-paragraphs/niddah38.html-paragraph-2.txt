 After giving birth to a girl, and observing the fourteen days of labor-caused ritual impurity, the woman is pure for the next sixty-six days, even if she sees blood. What happens if she became pregnant at the beginning of these pure days, but then had a miscarriage before they were up? Is the blood of this second childbirth also pure? The Sages says that indeed all her blood during those eighty days is pure. Of course, when she actually delivers a fetus, she has a different ritual impurity - that of giving birth. However, Rabbi Eliezer says that only normal blood is excluded, because it is connected to the first birth, but not this blood, which is connected to the second birth.
