Niddah 12 - Overtures Shmuel elucidated the previous ruling about checks: it was only taught in regard to ritual purity of sacrificial foods; however, the couple can engage in relations without such checks. Rabbi Zeira inquired, "Can she be more stringent and examine herself anyway?" Ravi Yehudah answered, "No." Rabbi Zeira asked, "But what would be wrong if she does, out of piety?" Rav Yehudah answered, "No, she should not, because it may put a strain on the relationship."
