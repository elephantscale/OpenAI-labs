 A groom is exempt from saying the Shema from the first night after his marriage (which was usually performed on Wednesday), and until after Shabbat - if he was not yet intimate with her. All this time he is too nervous to concentrate on saying the Shema, but after Shabbat he will be more at ease with his wife, and will be able to concentrate.
