 If glass is indeed similar to metal, then flat glass utensils should accept impurity just like flat metal utensils do - and we know that this is not true about glass!? - The Sages, when they gave impurity to glassware, wanted to make it different from metal, to remind people that this impurity is only decreed by the Sages, and that when an impure glassware utensil touches ritually pure foods, these foods should not be burned on account of this. The Sages therefore gave glass the laws that are somewhat different from the laws of metal, to serve as such a reminder.
