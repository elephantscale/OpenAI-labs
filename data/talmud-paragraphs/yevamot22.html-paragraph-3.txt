 The last point needs explanation. The Torah said, "Do not curse a prince (and anyone in general) in your people," so this prohibition only applies to people who observe Torah laws and do "the conduct of your people." This father sired a mamzer, and he is not doing the right thing, so the son should not be liable for cursing him!? - The father repented. But the mamzer is alive, so the repentance cannot work! - No, it can, because at least now the father behaves appropriately.
