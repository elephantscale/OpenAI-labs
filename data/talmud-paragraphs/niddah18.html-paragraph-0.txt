Niddah 18 - A Metaphor The Sages composed a metaphor to describe the reproductive organs in the body of a woman. They spoke of the room (the womb), the corridor (the vaginal canal), and the attic (the upper cavity). There are two ways to explain "the upper cavity." Some say that in ancient times, when there were no drugs or antibiotics, there could often be a "passageway" between the vaginal canal and such body parts as urethra. Others simply take "the upper cavity" to indicate any uncommon source of blood, such as a wound.
