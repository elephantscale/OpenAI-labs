 Why does the teacher start this subject at all?! - Since we just learned about Rosh Hashanah, where it is discussed when the world is judged regarding water and rain, it is now appropriate to discuss when to pray for it. But how do we know we should pray for rain? - Because of the phrase, "You will serve God with your heart... and He will give you rain." What is the service with the heart? - that is prayer.
