 Since people used to wear tefillin all day, what is the proper way to go to a latrine in them? Initially, they would put the tefillin in a window of the latrine, facing the street, and that is the opinion of Beit Shammai. However, people were stealing them, and once a prostitute took a student's tefillin and brought them to the study hall, claiming that it was her reward from him. After that, Beit Hillel allowed to roll the tefillin and take them with oneself to the latrine, holding them in the right hand. Rabbi Yochanan took it a step further: if he had a scroll in his hand, he would leave it with his students, but he would take the tefillin into a latrine, saying that once the Sages allowed it, the tefillin will protect him there.
