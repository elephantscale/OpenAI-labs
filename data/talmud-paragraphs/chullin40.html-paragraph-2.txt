 Rav Huna gave the following rule: if someone else's animal was lying in front of an idol, and one started to slaughter it - once he cut one pipe, or even less, makes a small cut - he made it prohibited for use. Even thought normally one cannot prohibit something that is not his, in a case like this, where he did an action, even a small action suffices.
