 Can we derive a Hanukkah law from the following law of damages: if a camel laden with flax was passing through the street, and his flax protruded into a shop where it caught fire from the shopkeeper's lamp, and then the burning flax set fire to a mansion - the camel driver is liable. If the shopkeeper has set his lamp outside, then the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Yehudah adds that if it was a Hanukkah light, even outside, the shopkeeper is not liable, since it is a mitzvah to light the Hanukkah lamp outside, to publicize the miracle. On analysis, we see that a Hanukkah light must be placed within ten hand-breadths above the ground because if it were allowed to be placed higher, the camel driver could have this winning claim: "You should have put your Hanukkah lamp higher than a camel!" - Not necessarily, since if the law would require a shopkeeper to put the lamp that high, he might not have lighted it altogether.
