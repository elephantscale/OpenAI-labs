 One man liked to say, "When our love was strong, we could have lain together on the width of a sword, but now a bed of sixty amot (100 feet) does not suffice for us." Said Rav Huna - and so it is with God, at first it was "...and I will meet you (Moses) there and speak to you..." from above the ten hand-breadth Ark, but later about the Temple built by Solomon "...Says God - what house can you build for me?"
