Sukkah 19 - Circular, conical, and reed mat sukkah If one makes his sukkah round, igloo-shaped, it is invalid because one cannot tell where its walls end and the roof begins - that is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. The Sages, however, regard it as one large sloping roof, and it is valid. Some say that the logic is correct, but the attribution is the reverse - Rabbi Eliezer says what the Sages say, and vice versa.
