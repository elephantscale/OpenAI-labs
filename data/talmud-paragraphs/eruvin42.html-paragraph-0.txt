Eruvin 42 - Shabbat on a ship If gentiles took him away from his residence area (techum) on Shabbat and brought him into a fold or corral, can he walk the complete area of the corral? Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar say that, since it is a private area, he can freely walk there. However, Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva contend that because he lost his techum, he can walk only four steps around, and that's it.
