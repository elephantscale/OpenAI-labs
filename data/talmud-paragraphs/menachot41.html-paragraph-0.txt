Menachot 41 - Opinion of an Angel about Tzitzit Is tzitzit the obligation of a person, so that when one wears a four-cornered garment, he needs to put tzitzit fringes on it, or is it an obligation of the garment, so that even while it is in the box, unworn, it already requires a tzitzit? Rabbah bar Huna prefers the second, so that even unworn garment already requires tzitzit.
