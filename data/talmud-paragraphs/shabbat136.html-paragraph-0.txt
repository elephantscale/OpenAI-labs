Shabbat 136 - How can we ever circumcise on Shabbat? We learned before that one is allowed to perform circumcision on Shabbat, although he makes a wound - because circumcision has to be done in its proper time, on the eighth day, even it if falls on Shabbat. However, how could we really say so, if before thirty days it is still not certain that the child is a viable child!? Just look at the following ruling of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: any child that lives for thirty days is not suspected of being not viable, but before - it is, since redemption of a first born child applies only after thirty days, because then it is clear that the child is viable.
