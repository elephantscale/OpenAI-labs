 A person's container can act as his courtyard to acquire items that are placed in it, provided that the container is placed in a domain where the container's owner has the right to place it. Thus a buyer can acquire items in the seller's domain by placing them in his container, provided that the seller gives him the right to place the container there. One can place containers in the public domain also - but not keep them there permanently.
