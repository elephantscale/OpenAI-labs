According to Rabbi Yehudah, there is the fifth hour when one cannot eat chametz but can still benefit from it, and according to our rule here, there is no such time. According to Rabbi Meir, it should say "as long as he eats," for otherwise "permitted" talks to one group of people, and "one may feed" to another!?
