 If an ox gored a cow that has been pregnant and killed it, and the cow's fetus was found at its side, but it is not known whether the cow gave birth before the ox gored it and the fetus' death is unrelated to goring, or it gave birth after the ox gored it and the goring caused it to miscarry - the owner of the ox pays half damages for the cow and one-quarter damagers for the offspring.
