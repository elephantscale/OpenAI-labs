 The proof of the Sages is from the phrase, "When a woman conceives and gives birth to a boy..." This implies that the rules that follow will apply only to a case when she gives birth from the place where she conceived. Rabbi Shimon, however, bases his proof on the phrase that follows, "If she gives birth to a girl." The words "gives birth" are extra, and they include caesarean.
