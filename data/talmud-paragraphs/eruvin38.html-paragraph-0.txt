Eruvin 38 - Eruv for two days If two days that need an eruv follow each other in succession, then one has to worry about the eruv for each day. Rabbi Eliezer says that when a festival (yom tov) is followed by Shabbat, these are separate entities, and he can simply prepare two different eruvs, stating which way he wants to go based on each eruv.
