 To allocate the whole and the broken stones, we determine how each wall collapsed. If it collapsed directly downwards, presumably the lower stones broke, and the rest of the wall fell upon them, so the whole stones are allotted to the owner of the upper story. If the wall was knocked over to the side, presumably the upper stones broke, and the owner of the ground floor gets the whole ones.
