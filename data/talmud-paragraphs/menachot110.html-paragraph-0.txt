Menachot 110 - Whether One Does Much or Little, but with a Pure Heart What does the verse in Malachi mean, "For from the rising of the sun to its setting My Name is great among the nations... all will sacrifice for My sake," for we see that this is not so? - This refers to those who study in every place on earth, whom God considers as if they serve Him and bring sacrifices. The verse continues, "and a pure flour offering" - this is talking about the one marries a wife and afterwards continues his studies.
