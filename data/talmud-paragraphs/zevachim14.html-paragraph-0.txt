Zevachim 14 - Walking with the Blood According to Rabbi Shimon, if a kohen has the intent that the sacrifice is of a wrong, different type, and he has this intent while walking with the blood to the Altar, the wrong intent does not invalidate it. This is because walking is not a necessary step, and if the kohen is close enough to the Altar, walking may be altogether absent.
