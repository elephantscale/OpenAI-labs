 How does one resolve this? - It all depends on who accepts responsibility. If a Jew stores someone else's chametz without any promises and guarantees, such that if it is stolen, he is not responsible, and in addition, he rents that place in his house where the non-Jew's chametz is stored - then it is allowed. However, if he accepts responsibility for it, it becomes in some sense his, and that chametz should not be found in the Jew's home.
