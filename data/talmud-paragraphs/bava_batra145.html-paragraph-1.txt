 It was customary in Talmudic times for friends of a groom to act as his groomsmen, that is, to bring him gifts in celebration of his wedding and to join him for wedding feasts, which lasted for seven days. It was understood that the groom would reciprocate when his groomsmen celebrated their own weddings.
