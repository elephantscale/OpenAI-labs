Zevachim 2 - For the Sake of Mitzvah Every sacrifice in the Temple has to be slaughtered for its own sake, for example, a peace offering has to be slaughtered as such, and not as a burnt offering. However, if one slaughtered them for a wrong designation, they are still valid and the ritual can continue - only they are not counted to fulfill the owner's obligation, so that he has to bring another one.
