 Rav Chisda says that these oils may be used for Hanukkah on weekdays but not on Shabbat. Why? According to him, one does not need to re-light the menorah. Thus, weekdays with imperfect oil are not a problem. On Shabbat, however, one may tilt the lamp to improve the light, for example, for reading - which may happen, because Rav Chisda does permit to use the lights of Hanukkah for personal needs.
