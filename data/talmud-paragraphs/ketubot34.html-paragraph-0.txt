Ketubot 34 - Liable on two counts - which gives? Previously we learned about an act that carries two punishments, such as violating one's sister, where he is liable to a penalty for violating a virgin, and lashes for doing it to his sister. We also saw a case of scheming false witnesses, who can get lashes for false testimony but are also liable to money payment if what they wanted to cause to their fellow with their false testimony would be him paying money.
