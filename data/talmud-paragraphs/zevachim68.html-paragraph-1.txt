 If an unqualified person performed the melikah (killing the bird with the nail from the back of the neck), it cannot be eaten, but it transmits no impurity. The same result happens when a kohen performed the melikah with his left hand, or at night, or if he slaughtered unconsecrated birds inside the Courtyard.
