 The Talmud ends on a teaching from the academy of Elijah: Whoever learns practical Torah laws every day (and some say, whoever learns hard, or whoever learns complicated laws like these of niddah, or whoever changes these laws every day) - such a person has their next world prepared. Why? Habakkuk says, "The ways of the world are His." The word "ways" (halichot) can be read as laws (halachot).
