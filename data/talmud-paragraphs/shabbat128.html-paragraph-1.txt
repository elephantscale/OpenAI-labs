 Rule #2: if a hen escaped from its house, we may push her back into it until she enters. Here too, although the animal is muktzeh, and in general it is forbidden to move the muktzeh or even a part of it, we may push her even with the hands, since otherwise she experiences distress and is exposed to injury.
