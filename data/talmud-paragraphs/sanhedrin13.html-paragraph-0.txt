Sanhedrin 13 - Semichah of the Sages If the majority of the Jews transgressed and worshiped an idol, because the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that this was permitted, and then they realized their mistake, the Sages of that Sanhedrin bring a bull, lean their hands on it, and confess. This is called Semichah, and three Sages are required for that.
