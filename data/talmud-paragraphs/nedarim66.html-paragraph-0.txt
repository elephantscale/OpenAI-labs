Nedarim 66 - I will not marry this girl! Initially the rule was that if a part of a vow is annulled, one still has to fulfill the rest of it. Let's say someone vowed against drinking wine, or eating meat. They tell him, did you realize that on Shabbat and Yom Tov one is not supposed to deprive himself? He says, "Had I known that, I would never have vowed" - and he can drink on Shabbat.
