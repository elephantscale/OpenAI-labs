Yevamot 32 - Wife's sister Imagine that there are two brothers (Reuven and Shimon) married to two sisters. If Reuven dies, the laws of yibum would dictate that Shimon should now marry his wife. However, she is the sister of Shimon's own wife, and one cannot marry two sisters. Therefore, Reuven's widow needs neither yibum nor chalitzah and is free to remarry.
