 A question was asked, can it atone for those transgressions that happened after it was designated by the owner? Since it can atone for multiple prior violations, maybe it can also atone for future ones? Or should we compare it to the sin offering? The sin offering is brought for a specific occurrences of a violation, for example, for violating Shabbat by mistake. It cannot atone for multiple transgressions, and of course it cannot it atone for future ones. If the burnt offering is like the sin offering, then it cannot atone for what happened after it was designated.
