Temurah 16 - Generation Descent When Moses was departing from this world to enter the Garden of Eden, he said to Joshua, "Ask me about any uncertainties in the Law that you have." However, Joshua replied, "Master! Did I ever leave you for a moment? Have you not written about me in the Torah, 'And Joshua his servant would never left his tent'!" Moses was pained by this answer, and as a result, three hundred law were forgotten by Joshua and seven hundred uncertainties arose in his mind. All of Israel wanted to kill Joshua, but God said to him, "I cannot tell you these laws anymore after the passing of Moses, following the principle that the Torah is not in Heaven, however, go and occupy Israel with war," and that is the meaning of the verse "And it came to pass after the death of Moses, the servant of God, that God said to Joshua... cross over Jordan."
