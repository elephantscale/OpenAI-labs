 The Talmud asks, "What's the question? He must reduce the gap to twenty, so he must raise it as much as needed for that." The question if then rephrased, "How wide does the floor platform have to be?" Rav Yosef says that just one hand-breadth is enough, but Abaye requires four hand-breadths. Since people are allowed to carry under the beam itself, they will notice even a small platform directly under the beam - that is the view of Rav Yosef. Abaye, who says that people are not allowed to carry directly under the beam - so that they don't accidentally step out into the street - will require four hand-breadths to be noticed.
