Menachot 48 - Do We Tell a Person, "Transgress in Order to Gain?" If, instead of two lambs, the kohen slaughtered four lambs for two loaves, he still has a way out. He can throw the blood of the two lambs for their own sake, and of the other two - not for their sake, but as peace offerings. However, he must do it in a specific order. He must first throw the blood of two lambs not for their sake, and only then throw the blood of the two remaining Shavuot lambs. For if you first throw the blood of the Shavuot offerings, you have ruined the remaining two lambs, following the objections of Rabbi Zeira that we learned before.
