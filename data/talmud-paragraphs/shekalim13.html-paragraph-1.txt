 Rabbi Akiva was one of the greatest teachers, and he arranged the vast body of the Torah knowledge in divisions and groups to facilitate learning. His students also enumerated multiple laws together, such as "four types of damages," "fifteen women who do not need a yibum," "thirty-nine labors on Shabbat," and so on.
