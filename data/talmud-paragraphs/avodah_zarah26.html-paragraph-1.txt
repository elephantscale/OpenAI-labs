 A woman should not be secluded with an idol-worshipper, even if his wife is with him, because of licentiousness, and a man should not be be secluded with an idol-worshipper because of the concern of murder. If traveling together, one should be watchful of the weapons of the idol-worshipper, and one should not bend down before him, lest he smashes his skull.
