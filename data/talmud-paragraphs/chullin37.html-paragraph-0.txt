Chullin 37 - An Animal that is Close to Its Death Water and other liquids are not the only agents that prepare foods to accept ritual impurity. The "love" or the "esteem for the holy things" is another. This unusual concept works in the following way: even the frankincense and the wood, which are not edible at all, can accept impurity if they are part of a sacrifice, and certainly food. This is derived from an extra word "meat" in the phrase "and the meat, anybody who is pure can eat the meat."
