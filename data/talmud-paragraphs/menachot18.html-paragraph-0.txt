Menachot 18 - Proper Procedure for the Flour Offering Yosef the Babylonian asked Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, "Teacher, if one slaughters a sacrifice with the intent to leave over some of its blood until the next day, what is the law?" Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua replied that it was valid. This repeated in the morning, but in the afternoon he added "but Rabbi Eliezer makes it invalid." At this Yosef's face lit up and he explained that finally after years of searching he found the source for what his teacher taught him. Rabbi Elazar cried with joy and applied to Yosef "How I love your Torah, all day it is my conversation."
