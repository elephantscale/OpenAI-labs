 If the protester tells the witnesses, "Don't tell the occupant that I lodged a protest," we assume that he means not to tell him directly, but they may tell others. Thus, this protest is effective. If the witnesses promise on their own, "Not a word of protest will leave our mouths," there is still a chance that they will reveal it inadvertently. Only if they are told, "Keep this completely confidential," can they be relied upon to keep it secret.
