Shabbat 143 - Bones left on the table After one eats a piece of meat and places the bone on the table, there is nothing that he can do with it, and the bone is now muktzeh - set aside from Shabbat use. Neither may one move husks. All this is what one would logically expect, but Beit Shammai do not agree to it: rather they say that the prohibitions of muktzeh do not extend thus far. Beit Hillel, indeed, do not allow handing the bones and request one to shake them off them table by moving the table.
