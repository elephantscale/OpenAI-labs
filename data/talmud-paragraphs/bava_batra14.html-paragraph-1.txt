 Rav Huna wrote seventy Torah scrolls in his lifetime, and only one turned out to be a scroll whose height and circumference were the same. Rav Acha wrote one Torah scroll on calfskin (which is thicker and thus it is harder to make it ideal size), and it turned out to be a scroll whose height and circumference were the same. The Rabbis cast their eyes on him in disbelief and he died.
