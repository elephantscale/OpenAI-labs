 The sins of the kings of Judah led Jerusalem's destruction, as described in the Book of Lamentations, which starts with "How does she (Jerusalem) sits in solitude!" Why was the word "How" (Eicha) used to describe Israel's fallen state? Because the numerical value of Eicha is thirty-six, and the Jews transgressed all thirty-six sins mentioned in the Torah that carry the penalty of excision. Furthermore, the Book of Lamentations is arranged in the alphabetical order, because they violated the entire Torah, from the first to the last letter of the alphabet.
