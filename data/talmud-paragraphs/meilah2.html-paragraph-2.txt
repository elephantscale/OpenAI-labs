 If one brought a holiest offering in a wrong way, such as in the wrong part of the Courtyard, or with wrong intentions, he again committed misappropriation since the offering was never usable by people. However, if the Kohanim were allowed to eat the sacrifice at some point in time, then it is not designated exclusively for the Temple, and one who uses it does not commit misappropriation.
