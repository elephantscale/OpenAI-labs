 Blood that originates in the "room" is ritually impure, and blood that originates in the "attic" is pure. If blood was found in the "corridor," it could have come either from the room or from the attic. However, since the room discharges blood frequently, and the attic only infrequently, the blood in the corridor is presumed to have come from the room, and is declared as definitely impure.
