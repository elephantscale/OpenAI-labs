The eight reptiles mentioned by the Torah are different from other crawling creatures: if one bruises one of them (such as a mouse) on Shabbat, he is liable, but for others (like a snake), he is not. The difference is that a mouse has thicker hide, and a bruise leads to blood accumulation, which is taking away a life, albeit in a small measure. The hide of other reptiles is soft, akin to skin, and the reddening caused by a minor bruise soon dissipates.
