 A boy can effect yibum from the age of nine: if his adult brother, who has the legal capacity to marry a woman, does so, but then dies, then this woman is connected to him because of his older brother, and this connection is what allows him to marry her. However, to receive a halitzah, or to give a Get (divorce), he needs to be a bar mitzvah.
