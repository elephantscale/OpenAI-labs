Avodah Zarah 51 - Accoutrement of an Idol If an idol is ordinarily worshipped by shaking a rod before it, then if one broke a rod before it, he is liable (to death penalty), but if he threw a stick at it - he is not. Breaking the rod is similar to slaughtering a sacrifice. Even though throwing a stick is similar to another Temple service - throwing of the blood on the Altar - it is not close enough.
