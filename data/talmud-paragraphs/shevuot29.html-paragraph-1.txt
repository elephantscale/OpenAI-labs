 Another example of a vain oath is when he swore about something that is impossible for him to do, or which is prohibited by the Torah, and in this sense impossible. Thus, if he knew a testimony and swore not to say it, it is a vain oath, since he is obligated by the Torah to testify if he knows a favorable testimony about someone. Similarly, it is a vain oath not to put on tefillin.
