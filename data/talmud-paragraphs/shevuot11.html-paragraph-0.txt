Shevuot 11 - Removing Holiness from Sacrifices When an object is donated or consecrated to the Temple, it attains sanctity and should not be used for one's own needs. Consecrated objects can be redeemed with money, and the sanctity transfers to money. Higher than this is physical sanctity: if the consecrated object can be used in the Temple service - for example if it is an animal fit for the Altar, wine, flour, or incense - then it cannot, as a rule, be redeemed.
