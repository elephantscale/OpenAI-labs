Brachot 41 - Which fruit to bless first On any food that does not grow from the ground, one says "Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created." This includes even wine that turned into vinegar, dates scorched by the sun, and locusts (for those who eat them). Rabbi Yehudah says that for anything like that, which is a sort of curse, there is not blessing at all. And the Sages? - They say that after all he who ate them derived some benefit.
