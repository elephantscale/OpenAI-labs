Temurah 29 - Harlot's Wage If a harlot gets a sheep as a renumeration for her services, this sheep cannot be brought as a sacrifice in the Temple. What are the particulars? If one says to a harlot, "Take this lamb for your wage," but gives her a hundred sheep, they are all forbidden for the Altar. Even though he promised only one sheep, and we could think that the other sheep are just a disinterested present, this teaches us that there is no such thing, and all sheep are her wage.
