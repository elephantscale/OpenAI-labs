 Ordinarily, when two pairs of witnesses offer conflicting testimony, the result is a stalemate; the court does not know which pair to believe. However, when the second pair impugns the first pair's ability to have witnessed the event altogether, the second pair is believed, and the first witnesses are designated false (plotters). Whatever penalty they sought to impose against their victim is assessed against them.
