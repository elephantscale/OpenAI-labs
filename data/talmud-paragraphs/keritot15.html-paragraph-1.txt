 What was the question of Rabbi Akiva, if we just learned cases where one brings mutiple offerings? - His case is special, because all prohibitions are in the same group of a "sister." And the logic of the Sages, it too can be refuted - in their cases there are different women, and Rabbi Akiva asked about one!? Rather, there is a phrase in the Torah that teaches this law: "The nakedness of his sister he has uncovered" - these are extra words, which teach that one is liable for each sister-related prohibition.
