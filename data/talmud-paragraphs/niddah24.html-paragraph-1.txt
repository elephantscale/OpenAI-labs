 The sons of Rabbi Chiya went to inspect their fields. When they came back, their father asked them if they were presented with any questions. They said, "They asked us about a child with unformed face, and we ruled this a viable child and assigned to his mother birth-impurity." Rabbi Chiya said, "Go back and retract your ruling. You thought to rule stringently, just in case, but you cannot do this here, because this stringency leads to a leniency in the end, when she is given a long period of purity following childbirth."
