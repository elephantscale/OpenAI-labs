 Rabbah bar bar Chanah was traveling with a caravan. When the caravan came to a stop, he ate and then forgot to recite the after-meal blessing. When the caravan started moving, he recalled this and thought to himself, "What am I to do? If I say that I forgot to say the prayer, they will tell me that God is everywhere." Instead, he told them that he forgot a golden dove. After he came back and prayed, he indeed found a golden dove.
