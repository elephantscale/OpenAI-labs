 Yet another attempt: if a husband gives a Get to his wife but then annuls it, the annulment is valid - even though this creates terrible consequences for his divorcee, who may not be aware of it. Rabbi Shimon says that the annulment is not good - due to the power of the Court. So to strengthen the ability of the Court, the Sages changed the Torah law and permitted a married woman to another man? Not true either, since every marriage contract has the phrase "with the agreement of the Sages," and if they later disagree, they annul the marriage retroactively so that the Get is not even needed. But tell me, this is where there was a marriage contract. What if one performed engagement by cohabitation - which is valid?! - Here the Sages changed the meaning of his cohabitation from engagement to pure pleasure.
