 This terse rule can be explained as follows. Ordinarily, flax is not considered wood, but it is called "wood" once, in the book of Joshua, "And she brought them up to the roof and hid them in the trees of flax...". Since flax can be used for a wick, and since it does accept ritual impurity, it had to be mentioned and excluded.
