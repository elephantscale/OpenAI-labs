 The blood is forbidden to be consumed in any case. Furthermore, one is liable if he eats the substances as "leftovers" or if he eats them while being ritually impure, and for that he still gets the penalty of being cut off from the people. "Leftovers" designate any sacrifice that is eaten beyond its allotted time. Consuming blood is also forbidden under the penalty of being cut off, but one does not get an additional penalty if he eats it as "leftovers" or while being impure.
