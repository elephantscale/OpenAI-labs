Yoma 75 - The affliction of manna In discussing food afflictions of Yom Kippur, the Talmud turns to manna, since it, too, is called an affliction: "Who feeds you manna in the Wildernessâ€¦ to afflict you." - Some say it is because they never knew what they will eat tomorrow, should manna not fall the next day. Others - that since manna could take on any taste but always looked the same, they were never satisfied with it. Rav Yosef (who was blind) demonstrates that a blind person eats but is never fully satisfied.
