Menachot 17 - The "Eating" of the Altar The handful of flour taken from the offering is burned on the Altar. If one wants to eat it instead, beyond permitted time, the offering remains valid. Actually, we learned it before on page 12, and it is mentioned here only to introduce the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who declares it invalid.
