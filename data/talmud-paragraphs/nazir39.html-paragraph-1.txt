 A question: is the hair growing from the root or the end? Why would we want to know? - If the hair is growing from its root, and the bandits gave him a haircut but left seven days' worth of hair growth on his head - does he now wait for thirty days still, or only for twenty-three? For example, if the hair grows from the root, then that hair he consecrated has grown down by now and was cut by the bandits, so he will have to wait another thirty days. But if the hair grows from the end down, then he will only need twenty-three days. So?
