Meilah 16 - How Prohibited Foods Combine All five foods called "terumah" - "first portion" combine to create a prohibition. That is, if one ate small amounts of them, but together it was an olive volume, he is liable. The foods are terumah of the Kohen, terumah that the Levi gives to a Kohen, doubtful terumah (also called "demai", "what is it?"), terumah of the dough (called "challah"), and first fruit - the last two, because they have an additional name of "terumah."
