 How do they hang a man? They sink a post vertically into the ground, and a beam protrudes from it. The hangman brings together two hands of the corpse one upon the other and hangs him by his hands from the beam. Rabbi Yose says, "The post is leaned on an angle against the wall and he hangs him in the way that butchers do."
