 What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? Burning on the Altar and eating is described by the same term "achilah," or consumption, as in the phrase "if some of the meat of the peace-offering will be consumed at all," literally, "consumed, will be consumed." Thus we see that the two are equated, and if one intends to eat what should be burned on the Altar or to burn what should be eaten by men, and plans to do it at the wrong time, the offering becomes rejected.
