 If one was traveling on the road and did not have the lulav, he can wave it when he comes home, at the table - since he can take the lulav all day. The waving of the lulav is done while reciting the praises of God and gratitude, called Hallel. One should preferably say the Hallel himself, but if he does not know, then others, even if they are not obligated, can recite it for him, and he will answer "Amen!" He deserves a curse, though, for he should have learned it himself.
