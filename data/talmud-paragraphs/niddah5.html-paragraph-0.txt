Niddah 5 - Fixed Period If a woman has a fixed period (either her period arrives on the same day of the lunar month, or after a fixed number of days from the previous one), she is not given retroactive impurity: if she finds blood internally at the expected time, all the ritually pure foods she handled prior to this remain pure, and only foods she handles from now on are ritually impure.
