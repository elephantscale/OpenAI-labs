 Rabbi Yose from Yukrat has a son who supervised his workers. Once Rabbi Yose was late with the worker's food, the son said, "O fig tree, bring forth your fruit for the workers to eat." When Rabbi Yose arrived, he apologized for being late since he was busy with a mitzvah. They said, "No need to worry." They told him what happened, and he said to his son, "You caused the tree to bring fruit before its time; may it be that you will pass before your time." He also had a gorgeous daughter. Once he saw a man making a hole in a wall to see his daughter. He asked what the man was doing. The man replied that he did not merit to marry her, but at least was it forbidden to look? Rabbi Yose said to his daughter, "Since you are the cause of the people stumbling, may you return to dust." Rabbi Yose's student deduced from here, "If he does not have pity on his son and daughter, I am in danger!" - and left.
