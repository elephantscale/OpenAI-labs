Chullin 117 - Which is Stricter, Fat or Blood? Fat and blood are prohibited in the same Torah phrase, "Any internal fat that is normally sacrificed and any blood you shall not eat." Both carry an excision penalty if done intentionally and a sin-offering if done by mistake. However, each one has stringencies not found in another.
