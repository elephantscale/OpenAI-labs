 On the thirtieth day, Rabbi Yehudah called for his nephew. Then he changed his mind and told him not to come. Why did he do that? At first, he thought to apply the rule, "Part of the day is like the whole day," and thus the period of excommunicated was up, but then he changed his mind. In any case, Rabbi Chiya came. Rabbi Yehudah asked, "Why did you come, seeing that I sent the second messenger for you not to come?" Rabbi Chiya said that he did not meet the second messenger. Rabbi Yehudah applied to him the verse, "When God favors a man's ways, even his foes make peace with him."
