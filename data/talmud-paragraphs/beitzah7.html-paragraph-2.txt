 What about Rabbi Yose, who says that the egg in such a situation is forbidden? - Rabbi Yose is talking about the egg that was not fertilized by a rooster and which the hen laid by warming itself against the ground. But if the rooster is present - the hen will not do that and will wait for the rooster instead, so we can be sure that the egg is laid by day and consequently eat it.
