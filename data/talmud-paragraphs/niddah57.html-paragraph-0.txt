Niddah 57 - Bloodstain on the Flesh If a woman finds a bloodstain on her body, then if it is directly opposite her genitals, she is ritually impure. These areas would include her heel or the big toe, because they can either potentially come close to the genitals or be right across. However, if the stain is on an area of her flesh that is not directly opposite the genitals, she is ritually pure. If it is on her leg or her foot, then if it on the inside (facing the other leg), she is ritually impure, otherwise, she is pure.
