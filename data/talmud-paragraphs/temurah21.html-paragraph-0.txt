Temurah 21 - Firstborn And Tithe Animals, Redux An animal cannot be designated as a firstborn, rather, it has to be born that way. Similarly, it becomes a tithe by happening to come out as the tenth, when the owner counts them coming out of a coral. Therefore, when one designates exchanges for them, these exchanges cannot be brought on the Altar. However, they do acquire other qualities of the firstborn and the tithe: they are let to graze, and when they get a blemish, they can be eaten by their owner. In this they are different from regular sacrifices: upon getting a blemish, they need no redemption and can be eaten by the owner, but regular sacrifices remain sanctified and require redemption.
