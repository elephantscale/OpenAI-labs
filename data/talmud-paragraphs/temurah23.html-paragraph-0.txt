Temurah 23 - Lost Sin Offering There are seven cases dealing with lost sin offerings. The first and the classic one was mentioned before: one designated an animal as a sin offering and it was lost, he offered another one in its stead, and then the first one was found - the first one is now left to die. A case parallel to this one: one designated coins for his sin offering, the coins were lost, he achieved atonement with another offering, and then the coins were found - he should take the coins to the Dead Sea and cast them into its waters.
