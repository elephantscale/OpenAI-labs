 Close to Purim, in Adar, there are four unique Torah portions read in the synagogue. Here they are. Half-shekel collection for the Temple - because of its timing next month. The portion of destroying Amalek - because of its connection to Purim. The red heifer - since it was used to purify the people before the Holidays. "This month will be for you to celebrate Passover" - because by then, it is already Passover time.
