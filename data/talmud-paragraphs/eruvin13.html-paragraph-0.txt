Eruvin 13 - The illumination of Rabbi Meir In reporting the opinions of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, the Talmud mentions Rabbi Meir, and continues with his story. Rabbi Meir initially came to study with Rabbi Akiva, but since Rabbi Akiva was a masterful logician, Rabbi Meir could never understand if his teacher was arguing a true point of view or just showing the logic of the opposite one. Therefore, Rabbi Meir went to Rabbi Ishmael, to get the facts straight, and then returned to Rabbi Akiva, and again learned the logic.
