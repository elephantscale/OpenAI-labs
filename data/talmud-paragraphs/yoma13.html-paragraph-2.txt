 After considering a few more conditional divorces, the Talmud decides to make it dependent on her action (if she goes into a synagogue, she is divorced) and then on his action. Finally: he divorces both wives conditionally: to one, he says, "This is your divorce (Get) on the condition that your fellow wife does not die," and to the other - "This is your Get on the condition that I enter a synagogue."
