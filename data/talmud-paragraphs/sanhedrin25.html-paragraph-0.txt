Sanhedrin 25 - Those Ineligible to be Judges or Witnesses The following are ineligible to be judges or witnesses: one who rolls dice (a gambler), one who lends on interest, one who bets on pigeon races, and one who does business with the produce of the seventh year. Rabbi Yehudah says, "When are the dice-players ineligible to adjudicate or testify? When they have no trade but this, but if they also have another trade, they are eligible."
