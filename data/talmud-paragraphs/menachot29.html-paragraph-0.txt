Menachot 29 - Crowns on the Letters King Solomon "Made the ten Menorahs of closed gold... finishing gold". Why "finishing?" Because it finished off all "closed" gold that Solomon had. And what is "closed" gold? When this gold was sold, all other stores were closed. But Solomon had more gold!? - Not of "closed" gold quality. Solomon used a thousand talents for each Menorah, firing it in the kiln until it became purified to one talent.
