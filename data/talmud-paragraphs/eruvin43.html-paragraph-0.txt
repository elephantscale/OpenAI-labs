Eruvin 43 - How high is the techum? The private area extends above until heaven and below as far as it can go; if one transfers from a public area to it - he is liable. However, public area goes only as high as ten hand-breadths, and higher than this its limitations do not apply. Of course, if one sits on a high pole in a street, he is nevertheless considered to be in the public area, since the pole rests on the ground. However, if one flies in the air, using one of the mystical names of God, do the limitations of techum apply to him? Can he fly beyond two thousand steps? The same question would apply for a ship that is flowing more than ten hand-breadths above the sea floor.
