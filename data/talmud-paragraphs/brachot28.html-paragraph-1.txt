 One of the disagreements was whether the evening prayer was obligatory or voluntary. A particular student posed this question to both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabban Gamliel. Since they gave different answers, Rabban Gamliel forced Rabbi Yehoshua to stand on his feet all day. Since it was the third time Rabban Gamliel acted this way, the Sages did not like it and removed him and nominated Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria instead.
