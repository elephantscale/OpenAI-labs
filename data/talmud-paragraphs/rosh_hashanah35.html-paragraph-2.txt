 Some say Rabban Gamliel exempted even those far away in the fields and could not attend the services. Others say that just the opposite, he exempted only them because the circumstances beyond their control stopped them from praying, but those who are in the city and attend services should say the prayers. Today, of course, there are printed prayer books, and everyone is obligated to pray using these.
