Meilah 6 - The Meat Was Taken Outside If the meat of a strict sacrifice (such as burned-offering) was taken outside the Courtyard, and then its blood was thrown on the Altar, Rabbi Eliezer says that it is still subject to the prohibition of misappropriation. We can understand Rabbi Eliezer: this meat has to be eaten inside the Courtyard. If it is taken out before its blood is thrown, it can never be eaten, and throwing its blood later does not help. Thus, it belongs solely to God, the Kohanim do not have any portion in it, and the laws of misappropriation still apply.
