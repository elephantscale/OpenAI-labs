Eruvin 50 - It got dark while on the road If one was walking on Friday afternoon, and he saw that it was getting dark fast, too fast for him to reach his home - but he noticed a tree that he knew was two thousand steps away from his home - then he should designate his residence under that tree. He would be able to walk to the tree, and then two thousand steps to his home.
