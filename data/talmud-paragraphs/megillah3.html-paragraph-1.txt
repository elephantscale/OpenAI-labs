 But is this really true, and the Temple service is more important than the study of the Torah? Don't we have the story of Joshua, where an angel came to him and said, "You are guilty of two transgressions: yesterday you neglected the daily sacrifice and today - the study of the Torah. However, I came only today because missing the study of the Torah is more important?" So the study of the Torah is more important, and perhaps the Sages should not close their books and go to read the Megillah? There is a difference: the Torah study of Israel is more important than anything else, but the Torah study of an individual gives the right of way to the sacrifices and indeed to the reading of the Megillah.
