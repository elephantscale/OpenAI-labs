 After the destruction of the Temple, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai established to still blow the shofar on Shabbat Rosh Hashanah in the city of Yavneh, where the Sanhedrin assembled. Here is how he did it. They told him, "Let's decide first if it is proper." He answered, "Let's blow now and afterward decide." So they blew the shofar. Then later, when they said, "Let's decide now," Rabbi Yochanan answered, "It is too late - the sound was already heard, and it is improper for the Court to retract its decision at this time."
