 Rabbi Tarfon wanted to declare only olive oil valid for Shabbat lamp, but Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri rose to his feet and said to Rabbi Tardon, "What shall the Babylonians do, who have only sesame oil? And what shall the Medians do, who have only nut oil? And what shall the Alexandrians do, who have only radish oil? Rather, do not add to any oils that are already prohibited by the Sages."
