 If one writes two letters, whether with his right hand or left hand, in any language, he is liable. Rabbi Yose say that the prohibition extends even further, and that any two useful marks, not letters, already make one liable. Others say that on the contrary, the two letters must be part of a word. Another question arises when one intended to write a long word, like Daniel, and stopped after writing the first two letters, dalet and nun, thus forming the word "Dan." Even though he did not complete his intent (the usual condition in Shabbat violations) , Rabbi Yehudah holds him liable.
