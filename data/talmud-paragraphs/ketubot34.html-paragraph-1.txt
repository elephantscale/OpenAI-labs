 To understand this deeper, let's consider another case: someone steals a sheep or an ox and then slaughters and sells the animal on Shabbat. Typically, one who steals and slaughters pays a special five-fold penalty for the ox and four-fold for the sheep (because, presumably, he carried the sheep on his shoulders, and this humiliation atones for a small part of his penalty).
