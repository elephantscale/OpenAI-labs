Menachot 102 - Everything That Stands To Be Redeemed Can Be Considered Redeemed This way of looking at things is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. For example, the Red Heifer was slaughtered in a designated place on the Mount of Olives, facing the portals of the Temple. It was then burned in a pit, and its ashes used for purification from the ritual impurity of the dead.
