 This rule, however, is obvious! Since he has designated white birds but found black ones, he has to deduce that the white ones flew away, new ones came in, and they are black, and he has not designated them, so they are muktzeh. Talmud would not teach the obvious. Rabbah explains that we deal with two different dovecots, one with white doves and another with black ones. The rule tells us that he can not just say that the doves exchanged dovecots, but rather that they all flew away, and new ones came in.
