Niddah 44 - When Do Laws of Purity Start The laws of niddah can potentially start on day one: if a newborn girl discharges uterine blood, she is ritually impure as an adult woman who has a menstrual flow. She remains in that state for seven days, after which immersion in a mikveh renders her pure. The earliest she can become a zavah is on the tenth day: she enters the potential zivah days on day number eight, and three days of discharge then would render her a zavah.
