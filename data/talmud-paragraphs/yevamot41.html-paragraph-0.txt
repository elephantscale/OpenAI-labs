Yevamot 41 - Three months To avoid the problems with the uncertain parenthood mentioned before, the Sages decreed that a woman should wait three months after her husband's death before marrying again. The Torah said, "... to be a God for you and your offspring after you." We see that one of the requirements of the covenant is to clearly distinguish between the offspring of the first husband and the second one. The decree was extended to all cases of marriages and even betrothals, where childbearing should not be an issue - to prevent confusion.
