Bava Metzia 99 - Responsibility in Transit If one was borrowing a cow and the lender sent it to him with his son, his slave, or his agent - or with the son, the slave, or the agent of the borrower - and the cow died naturally in transit, the borrower is not liable. Even the borrower's worker does not become an agent to assume responsibility for the cow, but only to transport it safely.
