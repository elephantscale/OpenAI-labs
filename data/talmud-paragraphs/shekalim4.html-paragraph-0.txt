Shekalim 4 - From whom they collected half a shekel? Fifteen days after the money-collection proclamation, Temple-appointed moneychangers set their tables in Jerusalem and elsewhere - to remind the people about their obligation. On the twenty-fifth day, they would sit in the Temple since the time was very close to when the new money will be taken out to buy sacrifices. Later they would even take pledges until people pay. An appointed court official would enter the debtor's house, take a valuable object, and not return it until the half-shekels were paid.
