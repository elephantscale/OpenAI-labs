 What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? The Torah said, "The next high priest from his (Aaron's) sons will bring it (the offering)," and Rabbi Yehudah takes the words "from his sons" to also mean our case, where the funds come from his sons. Furthermore, the word "it" means that in this case the offering is brought whole.
