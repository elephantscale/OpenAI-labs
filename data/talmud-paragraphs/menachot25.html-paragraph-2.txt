 How do we know this rule? The Torah stated regarding the head-plate, "So that Aaron shall bear the sin of the sacred offerings." Now, which specific sin does it mean? About the intention to eat it in the wrong place the Torah already said "it will not be considered," and about the intention to eat it beyond allowed time, it said, "It will not be accepted." The only one left for the head-plate to correct is being ritually impure.
