Chullin 109 - The Udder Since the Torah said, "You shall not cook a young goat in its mother's milk," only milk from an animal that is fit to be a mother and is alive falls under this prohibition. Still, the Sages prohibited cooking other meat in this milk. Nonetheless, the meat of the udder is different.
