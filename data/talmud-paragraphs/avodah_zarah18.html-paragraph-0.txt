Avodah Zarah 18 - The Burning of Rabbi Chanina ben Teradyon Rabbi Chanina ben Teradyon taught Torah in public, at the time when it was prohibited by the Romans, and for this was sentenced to be burned. They wrapped him in a Torah scroll and placed tufts of wet wool over his heart, to prolong his suffering. The students asked him, "Master, what do you see?" He answered, - "I see letters flying away in the air." They said, "Master, hasten your death!" He answered, "It is better that the He who gave the soul should take it." At this, the executioner said, "Master, if I increase the flame and save you from suffering, will you take me to the World to Come?" Rabbi Chanina said, "Yes." Executioner did so, then threw himself into the fire. The Heavenly voice proclaimed, "Both are ready for the World to Come."
