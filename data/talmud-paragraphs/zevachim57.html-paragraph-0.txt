Zevachim 57 - First-born, Tithe, and Passover Sacrifices The first-born, tithe, and Passover sacrifices are the remaining holy offerings. The first-born offering is a male offspring of a cow, sheep or goat; it is given to a Kohen, who offers it as a sacrifice. The animal tithe is taken each year from the newborns of the herds and flocks. Each tenth animal is designated as the tithe one, and then the owner takes it to Jerusalem, brings it as a sacrifice, and eats it there, together with his family and friends.
