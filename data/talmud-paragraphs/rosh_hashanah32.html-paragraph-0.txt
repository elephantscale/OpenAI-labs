Rosh Hashanah 32 - The prayers of Rosh Hashanah The prayers of Rosh Hashanah mention three themes: Kingship - the acknowledgment that God is King; Remembrances - God remembers the good deeds of the Patriarchs and of humanity; and Shofarot - mentions of the shofar throughout history. Every theme is expressed by ten phrases. When these are said, we also blow the shofar. However, often they blow the shofar later in the prayer not to disturb the people's concentration.
