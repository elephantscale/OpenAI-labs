Yoma 7 - Is everything permitted? Previously we mentioned that if all priests are ritually impure, they can bring sacrifices in the state of impurity. However, does this mean that everything is permitted and that the laws of purity are temporarily abrogated, or perhaps we only make an exception where we have to? For example, if the priest shift who is serving this week is completely impure - on the first point of view, they would do the service, but on the second point of view - another group of the priest, from a different week, would be invited. Rav Nachman represents the first, more lenient point of view, and Rav Sheshet - the second, more stringent.
