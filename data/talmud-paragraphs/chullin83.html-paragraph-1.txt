 What is considered "one day" regarding the prohibition of "it and its offspring?" As Ben Zoma interpreted, "one day" is mentioned describing the creation of the world, and there it means "there was evening and there was morning, one day," and "one day" is mentioned for the "cow and its offspring." In both cases the day starts in the evening at sunset and continues on the next day till sunset.
