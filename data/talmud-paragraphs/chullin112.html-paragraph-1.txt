 Rav Elazar was once serving Shmuel at a meal, and they brought Shmuel such fish, and he ate it with a sauce made with milk. He offered some to Rav Elazar, who refused. Shmuel then said, "I served it to your teacher, Rav, and he ate!" When Rav Elazar asked Rav about this, Rav said, "Shmuel could not serve me anything forbidden!" Indeed, the law follows Shmuel.
