 What about one who is only deaf or only mute? Generally, he has to do the mitzvot, but he still does not have to go to the Temple. Why? We have to admit that our ruling is incomplete, and the teacher intentionally omitted some words. Since going to the Temple on a Holiday is for the purpose of hearing and learning, and one who is deaf cannot hear, while a mute cannot learn, they don't have to go. However, the joy of the Holiday is still for them, and they should bring a "peace offering of joy" and eat it.
