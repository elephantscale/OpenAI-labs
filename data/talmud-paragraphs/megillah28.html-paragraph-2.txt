 Since one cannot enter the synagogue for personal affairs, what is he to do when calling someone out of it? - He should come in and sit down. Then, if he knows certain portions of the Talmud or the Torah, he should recite them. If not, he can ask a child to repeat for him what the child learned today. Thus, he has converted his visit from personal to one for study or for prayer.
