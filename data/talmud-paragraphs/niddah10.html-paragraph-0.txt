Niddah 10 - Laws of a Very Young Girl The following deals only with the laws of purity in regard to the Temple and foods that need to remain ritually pure. If a young girl whose time to discharge blood has not yet arrived - that is, she has not reached the age - discharged blood, then the first time she has the presumption of ritual purity, and all foods that she handled prior remain pure. After the second time she is still not given retroactive impurity, and only after the third time she has the law of all other women, and the foods that she handled become retroactively impure, back to the time of a previous check, but no more than twenty-four hours back. If she then misses three periods, she has the presumption of purity again. This, however, is only the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who states that three missed periods remove her from retroactive impurity.
