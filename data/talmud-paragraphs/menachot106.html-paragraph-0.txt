Menachot 106 - One Who Forgot How Much Flour He Promised We learned before that one who forgot how much flour he promised brings the largest offering, that is, 60 tenths of an ephah. However, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that he needs to bring every possible offering between 1 and 60 tenths. Altogether one brings 1830 tenths, which can be calculated by pairing the numbers, 1+60, 2+59, and so on, 30 times (Tosafot). Every toddler mathematician invents this formula, and Gauss did it when his teacher told him to sum up the numbers from 1 to 100.
