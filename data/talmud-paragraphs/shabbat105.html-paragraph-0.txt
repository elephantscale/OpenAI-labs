Shabbat 105 - Abbreviations Abbreviations are used in many places in the text of the Torah. For example, in the First Commandment, "I am God your Lord" the word "I" has a somewhat unusual long form, "Anochi". This stands for "Ana nafshi ketivat yahavit" and means "I Myself wrote and gave the Torah."
