Zevachim 78 - Blood Mixed with Water If, before the Kohen got a chance to throw the blood on the Altar, some water fell into the vessel with the blood, then if the mixture has the appearance of blood, it is still valid. This is true even if there is more water than blood, and even though some unconsecrated water will be thrown on the Altar - since it is not the intent of the Kohen to throw water.
