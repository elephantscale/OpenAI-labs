 In fact, during the 410 years of the First Temple, there were a total of eighteen High Priests, which makes for 22 years in service on average. However, during the Second Temple, when they would buy High Priesthood with money, there were 300 of them during the 420 years of the Temple. If you subtract the forty years of service of Shimon the Righteous, eighty of Yochanan the Great, ten of Rabbi Ishmael, and eleven of Elazar ben Charsom, you will see that the majority of the High Priests did not live out one year of their service.
