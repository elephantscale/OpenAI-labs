 The testimonies of the two witnesses are not combined unless they witness the event together. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah says that even if they witness two separate events that occur one after another, their testimonies may be combined. The first teacher maintains that the maneh (100 shekels) of one testimony is not the maneh of the other. But Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah says that they testify about a maneh in general.
