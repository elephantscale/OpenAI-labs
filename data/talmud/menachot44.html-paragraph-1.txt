 There was a man careful about tzitzit but lax in other matters. When he heard about a harlot that took 400 golden dinars as her fee, he sent her the money and came to her house. She had six silver beds and one of gold, and she proceeded to the top one, naked. He wanted to follow her, but his tzitzit started pelting him on the face.
