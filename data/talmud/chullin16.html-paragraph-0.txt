Chullin 16 - Slaughter With a Sharpened Reed A hand sickle had two cutting edges, one smooth like a knife and the other serrated like a saw. If one slaughters with the smooth side of a sickle, his shechitah is valid. If he slaughters with a sharpened piece of flint or with a sharpened reed, his slaughter is also valid.
