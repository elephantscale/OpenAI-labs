 Take, for example, a case of violating his sister. The only way to be punished is to have witnesses tell him shortly before what punishment he will get (lashes). He has to accept it on himself and proceed. Now, if it all happens as described above, he does not have to pay the penalty for violating a virgin. Resh Lakish takes it further: if he was not warned, the lashes are impossible. Still, he does not have to pay since, had they warned him, he would not have to pay.
