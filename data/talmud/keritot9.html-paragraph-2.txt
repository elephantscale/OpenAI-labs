 Rabbi Chanina asked Rabbi Yochanan, "If one has relations with multiple slaveswomen in one period of forgetting that this is not allowed, how many sacrifices does he bring?" Rabbi Yochanan answered, "Five." Rabbi Chanina continued, "How is this different from five separate cohabitations with one slavewoman, for which one brings only one offering?" Rabbi Yochanan answered, "It is five different bodies." Rabbi Chanina asked, "What is the source for this rule?" Rabbi Yochanan answered, "...and she is a slavewoman" is an extra word, which teaches the additional liability.
