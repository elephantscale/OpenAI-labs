 On the other hand, knots that are tied and untied every day are not prohibited at all. For example, a woman may tie the opening of her chemise, string of a hat, or a girdle (a wide belt tied by laces), straps of a shoe or a sandal; additionally, one may tie leather bags of wine and oil, or a pot of meat, where a piece of cloth was sometimes tied to its top.
