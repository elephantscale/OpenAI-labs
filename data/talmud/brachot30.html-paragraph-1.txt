 If one is traveling on a donkey, and the time for Standing prayer comes, he should dismount and pray. If he cannot dismount either because of company or because there is nobody to hold the donkey, he can pray while riding, and he should turn his face towards Israel, and in Israel - towards Jerusalem, and imagine himself in the Holy of Holies.
