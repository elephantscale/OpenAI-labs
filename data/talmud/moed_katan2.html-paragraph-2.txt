 Take, for example, a field. If this field is usually irrigated by rain, one should not water it during the weekdays. The crop in this field can survive without his additional water, so watering it would only lead to further growth, and that is not reason enough to work. On the other hand, if his field is high up in the mountains, it depends on watering. Without this, his crop would be ruined. Then the farmer is allowed to water it.
