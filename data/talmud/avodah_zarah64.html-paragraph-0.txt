Avodah Zarah 64 - Can One be Paid to Destroy Libation Wine? They asked a question, "If an idol worshipper hires a Jewish worker to break barrels filled with libation wine, what is the law regarding his wage?" Do we say that since the worker temporarily desires the continued existence of the wine - so that he can be paid for destroying it - his wage is prohibited for benefit? Or perhaps, any action to destroy futility (idolatry) is permissible, and certainly the wage is permissible?
