 Nobody but another king can marry a king's wife. Thus Avishag, whom David never married, was permitted only to Solomon. Why did David not marry Avishag? Because for that he would have to divorce one of his eighteen wife, and divorce is harsh. Whenever anyone divorces his first wife, even the Altar sheds tears on his account.
