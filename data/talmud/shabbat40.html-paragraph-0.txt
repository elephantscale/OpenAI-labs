Shabbat 40 - Shabbat bath People living in Tiberius - a place known for its hot underground springs - invented the following device: they passed pipes through the hot water of the springs, and used these pipes to heat water on Shabbat. They reasoned that since the underground springs are naturally hot and are not heated by human effort, and additionally since they had constructed the pipes during weekday, they should be allowed to use the clean hot water. However, the Sages told them that if the water passed through the pipes on Shabbat, then it had the laws of water heated on Shabbat, and was prohibited for both washing and drinking; and if the water passed through the pipes on a festival (Yom Tov), when cooking is allowed, then the water was allowed for drinking, but still not for washing oneself.
