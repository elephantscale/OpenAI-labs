 We can very well understand the opinion of the Sages: only what the Torah rejected - that is, the intent to eat the meat of the sacrifice too late - only that is rejected, but why does Rabbi Yehudah declare it invalid? Rabbi Yehudah says that the Torah has stated the prohibition of eating the meat beyond its time twice. Since the repetition is not needed for its own sake, it teaches us an additional invalidation, namely, our case of intending to leave the sacrifice over.
