Niddah 47 - Metaphor of a Fig The Sages created a metaphor for each of the three development stages in the life of a woman, based on the three stages in the growth of a fig: a bud, small fig, and a ripe fig ("tzemel"). These are childhood (legal minor), girlhood (intermediate, quasi-adult stage, "naarut"), and full adulthood ("bagrut"). Childhood for a girl ends at twelve years and one day, and similarly for a boy it ends at thirteen and one day. Then, if she has the signs of maturity (two pubic hairs), the girl becomes semi-adult ("naarah"). Full adulthood begins six months after that. What are the sources for this metaphor? Bud is mentioned in the Song of Songs, "The fig tree has formed its buds." Small fig - from a ruling on when one has to give tithes from figs. A ripe fig, "tzemel" is an abbreviation of "yatzata maleah" - she went out full.
