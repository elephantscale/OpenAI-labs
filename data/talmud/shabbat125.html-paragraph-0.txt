Shabbat 125 - Prohibited and permitted Stones are normally not prepared for Shabbat use and are therefore considered to be set aside from use, or muktzeh. However, if this is stone is inside a gourd - which is needed to help the gourd sink and draw water - then if the stone is attached so securely that it will not fall out, it is considered to be part of the gourd, and the whole contraption is permitted to draw water with. Similarly, if a vine is tied to pitcher, it is considered part of the pitcher, and one can draw water with it.
