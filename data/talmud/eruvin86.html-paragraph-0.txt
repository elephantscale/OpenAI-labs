Eruvin 86 - Water between two courtyards When someone leaves his home for Shabbat, he still needs to be part of the eruv (common food), since he may return on Shabbat. Rabbi Shimon says that he does not, since it is highly unusual for people to return once they left for Shabbat - with the exception of a parent visiting his or her daughter-in-law, because then if there is a quarrel, it has a tendency to continue.
