 Courts would proclaim a fast when a military force passed through even without the intent of making war on Israel - because of a high potential of confrontation. Here is a related story. Pharaoh Necho passed through Israel, and king Yoshiyahu decided to confront him. His logic was based on this phrase in the Torah, "A sword will not pass through your land," and besides, Necho was trusting in his idol. Nevertheless, Yoshiyahu died in battle. Why was the righteous Yoshuyahu punished? - Because he did not consult Jeremiah, and thus did not know that his generation was not worthy of Divine protection and that the phrase did not apply.
