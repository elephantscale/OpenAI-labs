Niddah 69 - A Zav Who Died A zav (and also a zavah, a niddah, and a metzora - spiritual leper) who died, all convey ritual impurity through carrying. But - the Talmud asks - all dead bodies convey spiritual impurity through carrying!? - Well, here we are dealing with a case where a corpse lay on a massive, immobile stone. Since this stone is very heavy, then an object below the stone it does not really "carry" the corpse on top of it, and thus this object does not become ritually impure because of the corpse. However, if this corpse belongs to a zav, then the object under the stone does become ritually impure.
