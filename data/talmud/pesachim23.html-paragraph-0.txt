Pesachim 23 - Exceptions On the previous page, Rabbi Abahu stated a rule that anything that the Torah prohibited to eat is also prohibited to use and sell. The Talmud keeps asking questions about this rule. Take, for example, the Kohen's portion: a non-priest should not eat it, but one can use it for his eruv. Rabbi Abahu says that it is an exception: the Torah said, "This will be the priest's portion for you," which means that it is "for you," you can use it, though not eat it.
