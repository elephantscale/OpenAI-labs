Yoma 39 - He snatched the lot from the lottery box The High Priest would snatch the lots from the lottery box with two hands and then raise the hand with the "for God" inscription. In the other hand, he held the lot "for Azazel." He then placed the lot on the appropriate goat and pronounce "For God." The people would again answer, "Blessed is the name of the glory of His kingship, forever and ever." Why did he have to snatch and not just take the lots? - So that he did not intentionally direct his right hand to the one marked "For God."
