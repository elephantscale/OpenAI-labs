Niddah 20 - Shades of Color If a woman's blood coming from her womb is "red like that of a wound," it makes her ritually impure. Rav Yehudah explained, "Like the blood of a slaughtered ox." Ami the Beautiful said, "Like a wound of a little finger that was cut, then healed, and then cut again, and not the little finger of any person, but only a man who has not wed a wife, until the age of twenty." Rav Nachman said, "Like the blood of bloodletting."
