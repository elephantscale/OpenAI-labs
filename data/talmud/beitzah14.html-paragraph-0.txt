Beitzah 14 - Giving presents on a Holiday Since one can cook on a Holiday (Yom Tov), one can also grind spices. However, when crushing rock salt, she should do it in a manner different from weekdays. Why is salt different from spices? Every dish needs salt, so she should have thought of it and crushed it beforehand, but spices - she may decide to cook a special dish that requires them on the spur of the moment. Another reason: spices begin to lose flavor right after they are ground, so it is impossible to prepare them before the Yom Tov.
