 The Sages say that one brings an offering of uncertainty only when he might have transgressed a serious prohibition, for which he would otherwise have to bring a sin-offering. If one had an obligation to bring such offering, but Yom Kippur passed, he is now atoned for, provided that he repented and that he believes in the power of Yom Kuppur to atone for it.
