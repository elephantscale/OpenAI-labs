 If one took a fruit and, instead of the proper blessing of "Blessed is the One Who created a fruit of a tree" said the blessing on vegetables, "Who created the fruit of the ground," he has fullfilled his obligation to bless before eating, since, after all, fruit do grow from the ground. The other way around is not true, since vegetables do not grow on trees. If he said a generic blessing "Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created" on any food, he has also fulfilled his obligation, because his words are true. Nevertheless, one should learn the proper blessing for each food, and in this way he will praise God better.
