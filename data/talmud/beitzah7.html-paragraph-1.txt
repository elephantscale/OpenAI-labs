 What practical lesson does this teach? The following: if one checked a coup before the Holiday (Yom Tov) and there were no eggs, and then he checked early in the morning and found an egg, he can eat that egg because he can be assured that the hen laid it during the day - just that he missed it. But what if he checked really well? - Perhaps the egg came out only partially and then returned - but it is still considered laid the day before the Holiday and is therefore permitted.
