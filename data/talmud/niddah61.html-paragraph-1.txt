 If three women were sleeping in a bed - but we just had such a case! - there, they were pressed against each other, but here there is some distance - and blood was found under the middle one (the bed is against the wall), then all three are ritually impure. However, if it was found under the one farthest from the wall, then two are impure, but the one next to the wall is pure.
