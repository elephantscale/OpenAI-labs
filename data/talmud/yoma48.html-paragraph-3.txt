 As a preface to his third question, we need to recall that if one spilled the blood of a sacrifice on the floor and then scooped it back up, it is invalid, but if he received it into a vessel, then spilled from the vessel and scooped back, then it is valid. In the case of High Priest, if he spills the incense from his hands onto the floor and picks it up - is this valid, or does he have to scoop again from the shovel? Do we compare his hands to the animal's neck so that his procedure is invalid, as above, or do we compare his hands to a Temple's vessel, and then it is valid? The questions above remain without an answer.
