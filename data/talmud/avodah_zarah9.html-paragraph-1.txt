 The Romans fought thirty-two battles against the Greeks but were unable to overcome them, until they accepted Israel as a partner. They then sent a message to the Greeks: "Until now we were fighting with weapons, but now let's reason. If one has a carbuncle and a Torah scroll, which one should be made into a setting for the other?" The Greeks replied, "The carbuncle should be the setting for the Torah scroll." The Romans then replied, "If so, we have a Torah scroll with us, for Israel is with us." Then they went ahead and defeated the Greeks.
