Taanit 22 - Military mistake of Yoshiyahu The merit of the righteous people protects those around them. Rabbi Beroka once asked Elijah the Prophet, "Who in this marketplace deserves to be in the World to Come right now?" Elijah pointed out a Jewish man who was wearing non-Jewish clothes. Rabbi Beroka asked him what he did, and the man told him to come tomorrow. On the next day, the man said that he was a prison guard and kept particular watch over Jewish female prisoners so that they would not be violated. He would also inform the Sages of any evil designs he heard about, and the Sages prayed and annulled them. The previous day, he was rushing on just such a mission.
