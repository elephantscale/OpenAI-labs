Chullin 87 - Covering the Blood of Multiple Animals For multiple acts of slaughter, one needs to cover the blood only once - whether he slaughters a hundred wild animals, a hundred birds, or animals and birds. Rabbi Yehudah requires separate covering for an animal and a bird since the Torah said, "animal or bird."
