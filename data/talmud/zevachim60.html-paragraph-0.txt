Zevachim 60 - The Copper Altar The Copper (Outer) Altar of Moses can be compared either to the Inner Altar of Moses, or to the Outer Altar in the vision of Ezekiel, since in all cases the same word "square" is used. Rabbi Yose opts to derive the dimensions of the Outer Altar of Moses from his Inner Altar, because both were portable, while Rabbi Yehudah compares the Outer Altar of Moses with the Outer Altar in the vision of Ezekiel.
