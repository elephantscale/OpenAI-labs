Chullin 85 - Covering the Blood in Cases of Unfit Slaughter Rav Eina gave an authoritative discourse and said that one who slaughters for a dangerously sick person on Shabbat should also cover the bird's blood. Rabbah was stupefied and said, "Even circumcision is allowed on Shabbat only for clear-cut cases, and not for doubtful ones, surely covering the blood should not be allowed!" But he was refuted from the laws of shofar blowing.
