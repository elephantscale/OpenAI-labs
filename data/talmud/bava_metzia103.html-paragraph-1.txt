 There are two arrangements under which fields are leased: sharecropping and tenant farming. A sharecropper pays the owner of the land a fixed percentage of the crops, for example, a half, third, or quarter, and keeps the rest. The tenant-farmer pays a fixed amount, usually using field's produce, but if it's not enough, he buys from the market.
