Horayot 12 - Good Omens Anointing a king at a spring is a good omen for his kingdom to last. On the subject of good omens, if one wants to know if he will live out the year or not, he should kindle a lamp during the ten days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, in a house where no wind blows. If the light continues to burn for as long as there is oil in the lamp, we know that he will live out the year.
