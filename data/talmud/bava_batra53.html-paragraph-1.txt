 After a price has been agreed upon, some indication of the seller's readiness to transfer property is necessary. This can be accomplished by the seller instructing the buyer to go and perform an act of chazakah upon the land. But where the seller is present, he does not have to say anything, and his silence alone indicates his acquiescence.
