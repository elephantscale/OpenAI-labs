 Because of this unity, one can open a new barrel of wine for sale. It will be considered ritually pure, even though everybody touches it, including ignorant people. He can even finish selling this wine after the holidays - for otherwise, he would refrain from opening it - in Rabbi Yehudah's opinion. However, the Sages don't go that far, and once the holidays are over, the wine is considered impure. Also, once the Holidays are over, all vessels in the Temple are purified. The two Altars, the copper one and the golden one, are never purified in a mikveh, and people are told to be especially careful and not touch them.
