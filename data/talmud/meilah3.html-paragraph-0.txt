Meilah 3 - If They Did Put An Invalid Offering On The Altar The Torah said, "Whatever touches the Altar shall be sanctified." This means that if some sacrificial parts were put on the Altar, they may not be taken down, even if they should not be put there in the first place. Basically this applies when the sacrifice was valid when it entered the Courtyard, and the disqualification occurred later, as part of the service.
