Yoma 88 - One should always forgive Rav was explaining Torah verses in the class of his teacher, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince. Every time a new student came in, he was forced to start from the beginning, out of respect for him. Finally, when Rabbi Chanina came in, Rav did not restart, and Rabbi Chanina was offended. For thirteen years, Rav came to ask forgiveness on the eve of Yom Kippur, but Rabbi Chanina was not appeased.
