Niddah 29 - Abortion of Unknown Nature If a woman aborted, but she does not know whether it was a male or a female child, although she is positive that it was a fetus, and not an empty inflated sack, she has to observe both set of laws, for a male birth and for a female birth. That means that she is ritually impure for two weeks, like for a female child, and not one week, like for a male.
