Megillah 3 - Which is more important? Purim is celebrated "in every province, every city, and every family." Since the intent is already clear, what do we learn from each word? - That even the Kohanim and the Levites leave their Temple service and go to listen to the Megillah. We can deduce that the Torah scholars, whose work is not as crucial as the Temple service, certainly close the books and go listen to the Megillah.
