 When Moses ascended to Heaven, he found God sitting and attaching crowns to letters of the Torah. Moses said, "Master of the Universe, what stops You from giving the Torah without crowns?" God replied, "There is one man, Rabbi Akiva, who will expound heaps of laws based on each crown." Moses was transported to the Academy of Rabbi Akiva, but could not understand his exposition, because Moses was used to know laws through revelation, without proofs. He became worried, but when Rabbi Akiva showed the students the Torah derivation rules he used, Moses' mind was at rest. "Give the Torah through him!" - said Moses to God. "No. Thus it came up in my thought," - said God. "Then show me his reward," - said Moses. God showed him how Rabbi Akiva was torn with iron combs and his body was sold in butcher shops. "This is the Torah and this is the reward?!" - said Moses. "Quiet! Thus it came up in my thought," - said God.
