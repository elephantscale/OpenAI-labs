Shevuot 42 - When an Oath is Not Required These are things regarding which one need not swear: slaves, notes of indebtedness, land, and consecrated property. Incidentally, for these things one is not liable to a twofold penalty for theft, nor to the fourfold and fivefold penalty for stealing, killing, and selling an animal.
