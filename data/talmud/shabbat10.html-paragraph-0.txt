Shabbat 10 - Giving a gift Rava bar Mechasya said in the name of Rav, "One who gives a gift to his friend has to inform him." What is his source? When God gave Jews the Shabbat, He said, "To know that I am God who sanctifies them." The words "to know" mean this: God told Moses, "I have a wonderful present in My treasure house, and its name is Shabbat, go and tell them."
