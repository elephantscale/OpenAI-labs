Shabbat 8 - Throwing a basket If one threw a round wicker basket from the street (public domain) into a private domain (courtyard), and the basket was ten hand-breadths high and over six hand-breadths in diameter, then he has thrown not an object but another domain, and for that he is not liable. That is because a basket which is that big qualifies as a private domain itself, and one is only liable for throwing objects, not domains. However, if it was smaller than six hand-breadths in diameter, then it is not a domain but an object, and for that he is liable.
