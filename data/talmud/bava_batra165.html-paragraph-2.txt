 Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai also subscribes to the "by way of example" idea, as in the case of a woman who appointed an agent to accept her betrothal money of a silver dinar, but the agent accepted a gold dinar. She mentioned the silver dinar only by way of example, and she is betrothed with a golden dinar.
