Kiddushin 73 - Whom Can a Convert Marry? Rava lectured in Mechuza: "A convert is permitted to marry a daughter of a Kohen." The people of Mechuza loaded him with fine silks. He then taught them: "A convert is permitted to marry a woman who is a mamzer." They said to him: "You have ruined the effect of the first statement you made."
