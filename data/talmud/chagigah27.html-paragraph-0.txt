Chagigah 27 - During Festivals, all Israel are trusted friends We mentioned (and this is for the last time in this Tractate) that ignorant people, who are not knowledgeable in the laws of ritual purity, cannot be trusted about it: their garments and vessels are considered impure. However, at the Festivals, this changes, and all are treated as trusted friends ("chaverim"). This is based on the phrase "And all Israel gathered to the city as one, and they were friends" ("chaverim"). and on the custom of all Jews to purify themselves and their utensils for the Festivals.
