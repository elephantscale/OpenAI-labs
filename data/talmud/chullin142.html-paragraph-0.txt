Chullin 142 - Reward for the Mitzvot One may not take the mother bird while on her young even if he needs her to purify the leper and allow him to enter the Temple. This is true even though he wants to send her away as part of the purification ritual. By sending the bird away he loses a small amount of money, and still the Torah promised "that it will be good for you and you will live long." How much more so does this apply to the difficult commandments of the Torah.
