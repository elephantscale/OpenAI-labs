 In a similar vein, "any brother" to whom the mitzvah of yibum applies also includes a mamzer. He is also a real brother for burial - so that if the father is a Kohen, and this son of his dies, then other brothers are permitted to go to the cemetery for his burial. This brother also inherits together with the other brothers, and he is liable for cursing his father.
