Yoma 26 - The last two lotteries of the day The third lot was for burning the incense, and only the Kohanim who never burned incense before would be allowed to take part in it. Why? - Because it makes one rich. And how do we know that? - Because the Torah said, "They shall bring incense in Your presence," and right after that, "bless, O God, his resources." Finally, the fourth and last lot was to select who will take the limbs of the sacrifice from the ramp and bring them to the Altar.
