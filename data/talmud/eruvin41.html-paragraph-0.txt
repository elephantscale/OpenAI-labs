Eruvin 41 - Residence area (techum) Continuing with special days adjacent to each other, the Talmud discusses the fast of Tisha B'Av, commemorating the destruction of the Temple, which falls adjacent to Shabbat. Should one complete the fast and maintain his profound grief, or should he eat a little so as not to enter Shabbat while suffering? For example, Rabbi Akiva would eat a raw egg without salt. The final conclusion is that one should complete a full fast until it is definitely night, and only then start the Shabbat meal.
