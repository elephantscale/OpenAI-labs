 Rabbi Dosa says that one makes his prayer conditional: "Strengthen us on this new moon which is Rosh Hashanah, whether it is today or tomorrow." On the next day, he adds, "Whether it is today or was yesterday." If one does not phrase his prayer this way, it will contain a false statement. However, the Sages do not agree, saying that if you phrase your prayers conditionally, then the people will treat the holiday lightly and may do work on it.
