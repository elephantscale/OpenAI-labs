Shabbat 131 - Violating Shabbat to do a mitzvah We saw earlier that Rabbi Eliezer allows to prepare for a mitzvah on Shabbat, even if one has to do a prohibited work. Actually, Rabbi Eliezer allows this for most other mitzvot, with only two exception: tying a tzitzit on his garment and putting a mezuzah on his door. Why are these the exceptions? - Even though it is true that his garment may need a tzitzit, on Shabbat he may renounce the ownership of his garment or his house altogether, and thus temporarily avoid doing the mitzvah.
