Taanit 25 - Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa Earlier, we mentioned that the High Priest's prayer was no match to that of Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa. In his merit, the world was sustained, but Rabbi Chanina himself only had a bag of carob nuts a week. His wife was embarrassed by their poverty and would put smoking wood into her empty oven on Friday. Once, her neighbor decided to check what she was baking - since she knew that they had nothing - and knocked on the door. R. Chanina's wife hid inside. However, the neighbor saw an oven full of bread and called - "Your bread is being burned, bring a shovel!" R' Chanina's wife replied that she went for the shovel herself. This was actually true since she was used to miracles.
