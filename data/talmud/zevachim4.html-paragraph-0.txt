Zevachim 4 - For the Sake of the Sacrifice There are four distinct actions in bringing a sacrifice, and each is considered a separate sacrificial service: slaughter, reception of the blood into a Temple vessel, carrying the blood to the Altar, and throwing it on the Altar. Each of the four services has to be done for the sake of the sacrifice - that is, the one who is doing the service needs to keep in mind, and not declare otherwise, that he is doing this service for the peace offering, burnt offering, etc.
