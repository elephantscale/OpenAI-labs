 All this assumes that we take the written text of the Torah as definitive. There is another point of view, however. In it, that the definitive is how the words are pronounced in the synagogues when the Torah is read. The word is always pronounced "sukkot" - that is, plural. The first three mentions are needed for their simple meaning, but the remaining two extra words - each pronounced as "sukkot" (2) give us four walls. The last fourth wall can be only a handbreadth.
