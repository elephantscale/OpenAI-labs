 This explanation is hard to accept, though - not everybody is so knowledgeable. It could be that nobody does such searches. Instead, the man meant those birds that a nazir needs to bring if he becomes ritually impure - and this explains why Rabbi Meir says that he becomes a nazir. But perhaps he meant to pay for the bird sacrifice for someone else but not become a nazir himself? - We have to say that a nazir was passing before him.
