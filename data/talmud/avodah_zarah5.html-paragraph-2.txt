 Another opinion is that the decree of death is irrevocable, and had Jews not sinned, they would be free from any foreign domination, but would still remain mortal. It is based on "Observe the Torah, so that it will be good for you" - but not so that you would be immortal. And Resh Lakish answers that the decree of "death" can be fulfilled through being poor, because four are considered as dead: poor, blind, leper, and one without children.
