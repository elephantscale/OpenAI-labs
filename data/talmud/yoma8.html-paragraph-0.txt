Yoma 8 - Tzitz Tzitz is the golden head plate worn by the High Priest. It fixes the defects of the sacrifices so that even those sacrifices that were not normally acceptable become so with the help of the Tzitz. This is expressed by the Torah as follows, "So that Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings."
