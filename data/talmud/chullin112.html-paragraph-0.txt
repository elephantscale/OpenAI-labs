Chullin 112 - "Taste, the Son of a Taste" If fish was roasted on the fire and taken directly from the fire - while still hot - and placed on a clean meat plate, then the fish absorbs the taste of meat, which in turn has been previously absorbed by the plate. The fish is thus removed from direct contact with meat, and its taste of meat is what is called "taste, the son of a taste." Rav said about this imparted meat taste that this fish should not be eaten with milk products, but Shmuel said that it is permitted.
