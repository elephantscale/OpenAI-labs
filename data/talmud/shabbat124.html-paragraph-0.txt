Shabbat 124 - Prophet Nechemia and Shabbat Prophet Nechemia says, "During those days, I saw people in Judah pressing wine-vats on the Shabbat and bringing in the heaps from the field." On seeing this, he devoted himself to halting the Shabbat violations and restoring the special character of the Shabbat day. One of the measures that he employed, together with the Sages of the Sanhedrin, was the establishment of the prohibitions of "muktzeh," things set aside and not to be used on Shabbat. When the degree of Shabbat observance improved, the Sages gradually eased the restrictions. Most of the arguments about muktzeh on Shabbat are about how far did this easement go.
