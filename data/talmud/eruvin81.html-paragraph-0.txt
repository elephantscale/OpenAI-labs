Eruvin 81 - Which food for eruv? For the eruv (common food), which permits people to carry in their courtyards and in an alley on Shabbat, one can use any food that nourishes, except for water and salt - this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. As long as it is edible, food is considered uniting people. However, Rabbi Yehoshua says that it can be only bread, for otherwise people in the courtyard will not take it seriously. Moreover, it should be whole loaves of bread: a large broken piece cannot be used, whereas a small whole loaf can. Why? - Eruv is used to promote peace between neighbors, and there should be no jealousy, which may result if some people contribute pieces of bread, and some - whole loaves.
