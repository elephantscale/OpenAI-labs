Chullin 28 - Is Shechitah Required for Birds? Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak ben Pinchas, "There is no requirement for kosher slaughter of birds in the Torah." Rather, it was instituted by the Sages. Granted, if the bird dies by itself or from a blow to a part of its body, it does become a nevelah and may not be eaten. However, one can kill the bird by tearing or piercing its pipes, and that would be sufficient. The hint to this in the Torah is found in the requirement to cover the blood of a killed bird, - meaning, covering the blood is all that is required.
