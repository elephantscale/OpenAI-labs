 Earlier in Eruvin, we had a similar disagreement concerning a pavilion - does its roof's edge come down and make a wall (which would permit carrying in it on Shabbat). Perhaps Rav, who said that it does, lends support to Abaye in this case? - No, perhaps he does not: in the case of the pavilion, its own roof could serve as its wall, but here in the case of sukkah, we want to use the roofs of the porches - may be here even Rav would not say that it is valid.
