 A similar example: a woman who says, "I was abducted by idolaters, but I am pure," is believed and can get married to a Kohen - even though usually any woman who had relations with an idolater cannot marry a Kohen any longer. If we only know about her capture from her, we believe her other statement. If, however, there was a witness to her being captured, she must bring more decisive proof.
