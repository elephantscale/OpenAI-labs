Yevamot 82 - Things that are always counted Earlier we saw that an androgynous Kohen is considered a male, to the point that his marriage to a woman qualifies her to eat the priest's portion of grain. Rabbi Yochanan says that this designation of him as a male is definite, because otherwise he would not be giving his wife the right to eat the priest's portion, for which a regular person is liable to death by the hand of Heaven. This logic is valid, because the laws of priest's portion (terumah) are valid even today, when there is diaspora.
