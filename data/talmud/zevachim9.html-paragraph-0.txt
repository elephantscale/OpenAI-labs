Zevachim 9 - Passover Sacrifice At the Wrong Time A Passover sacrifice, brought in its proper time, is valid if done for its sake, but is completely invalid if it is done for the sake of another sacrifice. However, the same Passover sacrifice, brought at any other time of the year, is invalid, if brought for its (Passover) sake, but valid, if brought for the sake of any other sacrifice.
