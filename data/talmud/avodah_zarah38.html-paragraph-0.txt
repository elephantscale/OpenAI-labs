Avodah Zarah 38 - Cooked Food of Idolaters Cooked food of idolaters is prohibited even when it is cooked in kosher utensils and all its ingredients are kosher. Why? - Because the Jews sent a message to Sichon, King of the Amorites, "We will buy your food and eat, and buy your water and drink." This means that they will only eat food that has not changed from its raw state, just like water. But if so, then parched grains made by idolaters should be forbidden, and we know that they are allowed?! - Rather, this Torah phrase serves only as a hint, and the prohibition is Rabbinical.
