 There was an old scroll in Jerusalem which supported Rabbi Yehoshua. The scroll also told that Manasseh (an idolatrous king) killed the prophet Isaiah (who was his grandfather). Here is how it happened. First, Manasseh judged Isaiah as a false prophet. He said, "You claim to have seen God, but Moses, your teacher said that one cannot see God and live.""Manasseh found two more such contradictions. Isaiah had explanations for all of them but decided not to say them. He judged that Manasseh would not accept them but act in cold blood and preferred to keep him ignorant and erring. Instead, Isaiah said the unique name of God and was absorbed into a cedar tree. His tzitzit was visible, however, and the servants of Manasseh began to chop the cedar. When they came to Isaiah's mouth, he died. Why did he deserve it? For the phrase that he said earlier, "I live among people of impure mouths." One should not speak evil of the community of Israel.
