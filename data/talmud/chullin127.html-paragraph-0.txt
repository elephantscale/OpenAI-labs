Chullin 127 - "Dangling" Limb and Flesh A "limb" consists of meat, sinews, and bones, whereas "flesh" is meat without sinews and bones. When these are completely severed from a living animal, both are forbidden to be eaten. The difference between them is that the limb is a source of impurity which it can transmit to others, while the flesh is only food, albeit forbidden, so it can receive impurity but does not generate it.
