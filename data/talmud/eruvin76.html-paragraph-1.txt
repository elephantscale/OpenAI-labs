 In this situation, the window can help both ways. If they want, they can consider the window as connecting the courtyards, making it in fact one courtyard, and then they can make a common eruv for all the residents in both courtyards, so that they can even pass things through that window. Or, if they prefer, they can say that the window does not matter, that the wall between them is a valid partition, dividing them into separate areas, so that each courtyard can make its own eruv.
