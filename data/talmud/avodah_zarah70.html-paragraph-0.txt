Avodah Zarah 70 - Alibi for Entering a Wine Cellar If an idolatrous harlot is having a meal with Jews, Jewish wine at the table is permitted, because they are interested in her, but not in making a libation of wine. On the other hand, if a Jewish harlot is having a meal with idol worshippers, her wine is prohibited, because she will not protest if they pour her wine as libation.
