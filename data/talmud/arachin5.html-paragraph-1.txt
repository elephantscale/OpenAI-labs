 An idolater can make regular monetary vows and be a subject of the vows of others. Although idolater's symbolic value for the Temple was not listed, Rabbi Meir says that he is nevertheless included, while Rabbi Yehudah says that he can donate other people's symbolic value but not his own. The Torah uses both an inclusive "a man" and exclusive "Children of Israel," but Rabbi Meir says that it is more common to be a recipient of a symbolic valuation vow, while Rabbi Yehudah argues that it is more common to be a giver.
