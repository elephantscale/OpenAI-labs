 More than thirteen fasts for rain are not decreed on the congregation. Instead, construction and planting of joyous nature are forbidden; people reduce engagements, marriages, do not greet each other, and behave like people censured by God. After this, exceptional individuals continue fasting until the spring month of Nissan, since after that, the rain, even if it falls, is no longer a sign of blessing.
