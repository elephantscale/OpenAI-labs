 When Ravin went to Israel and related this question to Rav Yirmiyah, the latter said, "Stupid Babylonians! They live in the low dark land, and because of that, their teachings are murky." (When they don't know a reason, they just invent it!) The real reason was conclusively proven by Resh Lakish to be this: in truth, this portion of the grain is pure, but the Sages, out of their love for holy things, decreed additional impurity on the planted grain and removed the power of the earth to purify it. Basically, however, it is pure, and thus it cannot transmit impurity further.
