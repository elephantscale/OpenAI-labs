 If the relative died before midday when the mourner was not yet fit to offer a Passover sacrifice, then the laws of mourning devolve on him first and prevent him from offering the sacrifice. If, however, the relative died after midday, the mourner was already obligated to bring the Passover sacrifice from before, and then the state of mourning does not prevent him from bringing the sacrifice.
