 If a dead body is lying in the sun on Shabbat, two people can come and sit by its sides. When it gets hot for them, they bring mats and sit on them. This establishes that they care for the themselves, not for the dead. Then, if it is still hot, they can bring a tent and place it over themselves (and the dead). Then they can leave, and the dead is protected. Are we using a permitted object for the sake a muktzeh (corpse)? - No, they use it for themselves. Then do we see that moving a permitted object for the sake of a muktzeh is NOT allowed? - Really, it is, but the procedure with the corpse also became law.
