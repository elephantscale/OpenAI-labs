 Rabbi Eliezer answered, "I also did not mean to pray for rain on Sukkot, just to mention God's power to give it." Rabbi Yehoshua asked, "Then mention it all year!" Rabbi Eliezer replied, "Actually, yes, you can." Good answer! And Rabbi Yehoshua? He replied, "I understand why we mention the Resurrection of the Dead because any day is good for that. On the other hand, rains are bad at harvest time and so should not be mentioned."
