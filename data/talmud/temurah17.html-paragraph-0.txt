Temurah 17 - Sometimes Exchanges Are More Stringent Than Sacrifices, And Sometimes Less Sacrifices are more stringent than their exchanges: a sacrifice can be used to create an exchange, but an exchange cannot be used to create another exchange; partners can consecrate an animal to be a sacrifice, but not to make an exchange; fetuses and limbs can be consecrated, as part of a live animal, but one cannot make an exchange of them.
