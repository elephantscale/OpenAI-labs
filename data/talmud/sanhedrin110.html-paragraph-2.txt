 I was one walking on the road, and an Arab merchant told me, "Come, and I will show you the site of the swallowing of Korach's assembly." He then went and showed two cracks in the ground which smoked. He took a ball of wool shearings, soaked it in water, put it on the head of a spear, and passed the spear over the cracks, and the wool was singed. Then the Arab told him to listen, and he heard, "Moses and his Torah are true, and they (we) are liars"
