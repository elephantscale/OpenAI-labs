 Here is an example. The two sons of Rabban Gamliel bathed together in the city of Kabul. The populace was amazed, saying, "We have not seen such behavior ever in our lives." At which one of the brothers left the bath, but he did not wish to tell them, "You are wrong, two brothers are allowed to bathe together, it is only that two brothers-in-law are not (because this may lead one to wrong thoughts about his sister)." Why didn't they abrogate the custom? - Because the people of Kabul, although somewhat learned, were rarely visited by Sages.
