Yoma 53 - How to burn incense Since the Torah said, "He shall take... the finely ground incense, bring it within the Curtain and place the incense upon the fire in front of God," we understand that he comes in with all the ingredients and then prepares the burning of the incense while already inside of Holy of Holies. This was not how everyone understood this phrase. The followers of Tsaddok said that the following words, "If he (the High Priest) comes in the cloud of smoke, then I (God) will appear to him there," - prove that the High Priest must come in with the incense already burning. What did the Sages answer? This phrase teaches not the sequence of actions but the composition of the incense - that there must be a special herb called "one that makes the smoke rise" included in the composition of the incense.
