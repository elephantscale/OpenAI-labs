Yoma 57 - Even when not perfect The goat's blood is subject to the same number and manner of sprinklings against the Ark as the blood of the bull. The verse continues, "And he shall do this in the Tent of Meeting that dwells among them in the midst of their impurities." This teaches that God's presence dwells among the Jews even when they are impure and imperfect.
