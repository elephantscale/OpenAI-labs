 But how do we know that the minyan is exactly ten people? - from the word "among." This word is used in describing the congregation of Korach. It is also used with the congregation of the spies who belittled the Land of Israel. The spies numbered ten. Further, from "I will be sanctified among the sons of Israel," we see that every sanctification needs a congregation, and this congregation is ten.
