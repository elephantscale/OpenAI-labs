Ketubot 2 - Marriages are for Wednesdays The custom was for people to get engaged and then take a year to prepare for a wedding. This engagement had more legal power than today: they were husband and wife, except not living together. When the time came to marry, girls for whom it was the first marriage would get married on Wednesdays. Why specifically on this day? Courts used to convene on Thursdays so that if he had any questions about his wife, he could come to court on the morrow. For example, if he had suspicions that she was unfaithful to him, judging by the fact that she was not a virgin, he could come to court and expect that the publicity caused by his actions could bring in witnesses of her unfaithfulness if such there were.
