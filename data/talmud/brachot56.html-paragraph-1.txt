 Bar Hedya was an interpreter of dreams. If one gave him money, he would interpret the dream for the good, and for one who did not pay him - for the bad. Once Abaye and Rava both saw the same dream, and they asked Bar Hedya for the interpretation; Abaye gave him a zuz, whereas Rava did not give him any money. In their dreams, they both heard the phrase, "Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat from it." To Rava he said, "Your business will fail, and on account of your great sorrow you will have no interest in eating," but to Abaye he said, "Your business will profit, and on account of your great joy you will have no interest in eating."
