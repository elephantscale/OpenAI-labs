 One who has both feet severed cannot walk without crutches. He will often fashion leather pads for his shins and knees. These are made to support his weight, so he may wear then on Shabbat; however, since they are not worn on his feet, but on his legs, they do not have the legal status of shoes, and one can enter the Temple in them (where the shoes are normally prohibited).
