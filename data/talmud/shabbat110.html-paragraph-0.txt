Shabbat 110 - Water left uncovered In Babylon, where snakes were abundant, there was a danger that water left uncovered might have been drunk by a snake, who could leave there its poison. For this reason, the Sages prohibited drinking any water that was left uncovered for enough time that the snake hiding behind the vessel might have appeared and drunk from. In other times and at other places this law should not apply, but it has mystical connotations, and is discussed often in the Talmud.
