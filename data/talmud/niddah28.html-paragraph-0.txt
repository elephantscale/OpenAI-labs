Niddah 28 - Corpse That Was Fully Cremated Earlier we saw the opinion of Rabbi Shimon that an afterbirth containing a dissolved fetus is ritually pure. In explaining it, Resh Lakish said, "It is similar to a corpse whose shape was obliterated, which is pure." Rabbi Yochanan told him, "You seem to derive your opinion from the rule that a corpse that kept its shape is impure. But perhaps its ashes are even more impure!" Incidentally, how can a corpse keep its shape after cremation? Abaye said, "In a mold of fireproof leather." Rava said, "In a mold of a marble slab." Ravina said, "If it was completely charred but not reduced to ashes."
