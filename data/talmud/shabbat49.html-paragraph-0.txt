Shabbat 49 - Elisha with the dove's wings Continuing with the list of materials that may be used to wrap, or insulate hot food before Shabbat - one can use clothing, produce (such as wheat or beans), dove's feathers, carpenter's sawdust, and flax combings - because all these don't add heat, an thus there is no danger that using them one can also start using ashes and then even rake the coals.
