 But logic should dictate otherwise: if turtledoves, which are not acceptable when young, are acceptable when mature, then pigeons, which are acceptable when young, should surely be acceptable when old! To dispel this, the Torah never called a pigeon a pigeon, but only a "son of a pigeon" to emphasize that only young ones are acceptable.
