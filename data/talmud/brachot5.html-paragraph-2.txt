 If a person sees afflictions befalling him, he should investigate his deeds since the nature of the distress may have a hint for him. If he examined his deeds and did not find anything, he should attribute it to the neglect of Torah study, based on the phrase "Fortunate is the man whom God afflicts, and whom You teach from Your Torah." If he did not find that either, they are "afflictions of love," since "For God rebukes the one He loves."
