Avodah Zarah 43 - Ornaments that are Often Worshipped If one finds utensils with the figures that symbolize dominion, he should take them to the Dead Sea and cast them into the waters. The customarily worshipped figures are those of a crowned king seated in a chariot - representing the sun, a similar allegorical figure of a moon, or a dragon - which some interpret as a serpent. The highly saline waters of the Dead Sea are not navigated by men, and there is little risk of anyone recovering and enjoying them. Rabbi Yehudah adds an image of a nursing woman, which was worshipped because of Eve, who nursed the entire world.
