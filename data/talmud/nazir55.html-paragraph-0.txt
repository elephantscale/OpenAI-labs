Nazir 55 - Nazir outside of Israel? The Sages decreed that anyone who left Israel would immediately become ritually impure to discourage people from leaving the Land of Israel. Ostensibly, this is because people who live outside of Israel are not as careful marking off graves (ground-based impurity), and one can pass over an unknown grave. However, the Sages may have declared the airspace outside Israel impure (air-based impurity).
