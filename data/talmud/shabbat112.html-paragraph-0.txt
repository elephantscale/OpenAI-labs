Shabbat 112 - And these are the knots... In the list of the thirty-nine types of work that are prohibited on Shabbat we mentioned tying and untying a knot. Now the Talmud comes to give examples of which knots are prohibited: the camel driver's knot and the sailor's knot. Both are meant to be remain tied forever, and they are thus considered permanent knots. However, if one ties a knot to these permanent knots, such as a leash to the camel, then this is meant for a week or two, but not for all time, and therefore it is not prohibited by the Torah. However, the Sages prohibited even such knots, because if they were allowed, people might come to tie even permanent knots.
