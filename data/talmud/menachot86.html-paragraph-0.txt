Menachot 86 - Which Oil? Oil had to be of superior quality. The city of Tekoa provided the "alpha" quality of oil, second to it was Regev from Trans-Jordan, and oil from other places was also valid. They avoided olives from fertilized or watered fields, or from fields where seeds were also grown. Oil from olives soaked in water, picked, or boiled was invalid. People of Tekoa were considered wise because they consumed oil regularly, and oil also led to great riches, as in the story about a rich farmer.
