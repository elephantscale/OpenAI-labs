 We can start with one fact that is certain: Rabbi Yosef ben Yoezer testified that the liquids in the Temple are pure. However, there are different ways to understand his words. For example, Rav understood them literally: these liquids are completely pure; Shmuel, by contrast, said that they are pure only in the sense that they don't transmit impurity to other things, but they themselves can become ritually impure.
