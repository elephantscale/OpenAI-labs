 Every blessing should be said according the form that the Sages created for it. What if he started with one blessing in mind but ended with another? For example, he took a cup of beer and thought it was wine, and he started to say the blessing on the wine (which is more distinguished than that of beer), but then caught himself midway, and finished with the blessing on the beer? The Talmud tried to find an answer, but all examples are where even if he made a mistake, the blessing would still be valid, while in our case it would not be. Thus there is no definite proof, but for a simple answer - it is the conclusion of the blessing that counts.
