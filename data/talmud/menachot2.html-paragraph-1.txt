 Flour offerings have four steps in their service, paralleling those of animal offerings. First a kohen takes off a handful of flour, parallel to cutting the animal's throat. Then he puts this handful in a service vessel - similar to receiving the blood. Then he carries the handful to the Altar - similar to carrying the animal's blood to the Altar. Then he burns the handful on the Altar, and the remaining flour is used for the consumption by the kohanim.
