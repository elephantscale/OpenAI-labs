Chullin 72 - Kosher Slaughter Makes the Meat Ritually Pure If an animal was in difficult labor and the fetus put forth its foreleg, and one severed it, to ease the mother's pain and then, since it did not help, slaughtered the mother, the remaining flesh of the fetus is ritually pure, since it has been slaughtered together with its mother. The severed limb itself is impure: if the fetus was alive, the limb was severed from a live animal and has the impurity of a dead animal (nevelah); and if the fetus was dead, the limb is actual nevelah.
