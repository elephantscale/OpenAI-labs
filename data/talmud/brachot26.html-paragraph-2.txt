 Rabbi Yose says that prayers were established by Abraham (morning), Isaac (afternoon), and Jacob (evening), while Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says that the Sages established them based on the sacrifices in the Temple. The precise timings of the prayers seem to indicate that they were modeled after sacrifices. What does Rabbi Yose have to answer? - That they were established by the Patriarchs, and the later Sages added timings based on the sacrifices.
