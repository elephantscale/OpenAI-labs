 One man was selling silk ribbons, asking six zuz, although they were actually worth five, and it was apparent that he would take five-and-a-half. Another man came along and said to himself, "If I give him five-and-a-half, it will be considered an immediate waving of the overpayment. I will instead give him six, and then summon him to judgment for the entire overcharge of one zuz."
