 Rav Yirmiyah asked the following questions: if he hung the pot on a peg, what is the law? Is it like holding it in one's hand, or is it like putting it on the ground? If he put it down on the bed, what then? Rav Ashi asked, "If he transferred the hot water from one kettle to another, can he return it to the stove?" These questions remained unanswered.
