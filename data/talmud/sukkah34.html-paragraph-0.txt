Sukkah 34 - The branches On Sukkot, one must take a bunch of branches - which includes the etrog (citron), a palm branch (lulav), two willow branches (aravot), and three myrtle branches (hadassim). One waves them in all six directions. The four types of branches or fruit have similar laws, but the teacher enumerates them separately because of some differences between them. One should preferably procure the best.
