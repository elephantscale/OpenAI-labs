 Concerning a Get that was procured by force, if the coercion was applied by the Jewish court and the husband acquiesced, the Get is valid. But if the coercion was applied by a court of idolaters, the Get is invalid. However even in a court of idolaters, they may beat the husband and tell him "Do what which the Jewish court tells you to do!" and the Get is valid.
