Shabbat 75 - A special talent in math One who has a special talent and knowledge of mathematics, astronomy and other sciences, and fails to use this talent, to him we apply the verse "And the work of God they do not regard and the action of His hands they do not see." Since he failed to use his chance to appreciate the God's world in full measure, one is forbidden to relate Torah teachings in his name.
