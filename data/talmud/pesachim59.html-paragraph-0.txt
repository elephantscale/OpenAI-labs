Pesachim 59 - What did you have in mind? In bringing an offering in the Temple, there were four steps: slaughtering the animal, receiving its blood in a vessel, carrying the blood in the vessel to the Altar, and throwing the blood on the Altar. If the sacrifice owner was knowledgeable in slaughter laws, he could do it himself, but the remaining three steps had to be done by a kohen priest.
