 The obligation not to stop your workers from eating at the time of harvesting is similar to the prohibition of "You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing," which applies to already harvested produce. Clearly, all animals are included, so by mentioning "ox" the Torah teaches another law: just as a worker is allowed to eat unharvested produce, so too an ox.
