 Rabbi Shimon tells a story to support this view. Tavi, the slave of Rabban Gamliel, was a Torah scholar. He was once sleeping under the bed in a sukkah, and Rabban Gamliel remarked to the Sages: "Do you see my slave Tavi? He knows that slaves are not obligated in the mitzvah of the sukkah (although they have to do many other mitzvot), and therefore sleeps under the bed!"
