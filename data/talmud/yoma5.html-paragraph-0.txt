Yoma 5 - How important was the first Temple service? Obviously, the first service, called Inauguration, or "miluim" in Hebrew, was important in that it allowed all subsequent services to proceed, but how important was it? What would happen if one skipped an element of it? Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Yochanan argue about this, with one of them saying that absolutely every element was important and missing it would invalidate the entire service. The other one says that acts that would not be essential in the future could be skipped at the Inauguration.
