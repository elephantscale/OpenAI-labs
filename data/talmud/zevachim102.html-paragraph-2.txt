 When Miriam contracted leprosy, it was not Moses, who was not a kohen, who pronounced her status, and not Aaron, who was a relative, but it was God himself, who also was a kohen, Who confined her and later released her. We see from this that Moses was not a kohen! - No, maybe leprosy is specifically given to the sons of Aaron to decide.
