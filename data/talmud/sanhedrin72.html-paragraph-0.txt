Sanhedrin 72- Judgment on the Account of the Ultimate End A wayward and rebellious son is judged on account of his ultimate end: having accustomed himself to stealing and indulgence, he will eventually rob and kill people. Therefore, let him die while he is still innocent, and not guilty of a capital crime. For the wicked, death is beneficial to them and to the world, but for the righteous, death is detrimental to them and to the world.
