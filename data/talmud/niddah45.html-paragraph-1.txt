 At the age of three, she creates a legal responsibility for anyone who cohabits with her - he is liable for adultery, although she is not, until she reaches the bat mitzvah age. In the same vein, if her prospective husband dies, his brother has an obligation to take her as a wife, effected as yibum (levirate marriage), and that can happen even when she is a minor. If she does not want him, she can give him a release (halitzah), but only when she is a bat mitzvah.
