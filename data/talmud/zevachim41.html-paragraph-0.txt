Zevachim 41 - God Conceals the Sins of the Congregation The laws of the communal offering are learned from the laws of the High Priest's offering. Namely, when talking about a communal-error offering, which is brought when the High Court renders serious erroneous decision and many Jews follow it, the Torah does not discuss all the details, such as burning of the diaphragm and of the two kidneys. These details are mentioned when describing the similar individual offering of a High Priest, and one is learned from the other.
