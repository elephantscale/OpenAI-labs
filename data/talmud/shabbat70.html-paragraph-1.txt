 Rava added that on every day he can only do as much labor as is needed to stay alive, because this might actually be Shabbat, and he can't desecreate it, even out of doubt. On the seventh day he does no labor. The Talmud asks, and on the seventh day he should die? - He should work twice as much on the day before! - But maybe the day before is Shabbat? Rather, he should work the same amount on every day. But then, how is Shabbat different? - Because he says the kiddush - prayer welcoming Shabbat - at the beginning of it, and the Havdallah - prayer welcoming weekdays - at the end.
