 One should say the after-meal prayer in the place where he ate. What if he forgot and went away? Beit Shammai say that he should return. Beit Hillel asked them, "If one ate on top of a mansion, and forgot and went down, must he return to say the prayer, even with a great difficulty?" Beit Shammai replied, "If he left a purse with gold, would he not return? How much more so for prayer!"
