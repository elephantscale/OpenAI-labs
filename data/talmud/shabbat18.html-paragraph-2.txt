 From where do Beit Shammai take the concept that one's vessels and machines should rest on Shabbat? - from the Torah phrase "Be very careful to keep everything I have said to you." It follows the prohibition of work on Shabbat and adds an additional prohibition. And Beit Hillel? They say that this prohibition is not from the Torah. They do agree, however, that when a working machine makes noise and gives an appearance of working on Shabbat - such as an automatic mill - that it should not be used.
