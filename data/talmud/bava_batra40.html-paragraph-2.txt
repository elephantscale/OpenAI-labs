 One woman said to a man, "I will marry you only if you give me all your property." His son wanted a share. The man then told witnesses, "First hide yourself and write a gift of all my property to my son." Both gifts were annulled: to the woman - because it was given under duress, to the son - because it was only for subterfuge.
