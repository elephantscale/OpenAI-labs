 Elijah the Righteous would seek out those bloated from hunger in Jerusalem, during the time of the first destruction. He found a child, bloated, in a heap trash. The child was the last from a large family. Elijah asked, "If I teach you something by which you will merit to live, will you learn it?" The child replied, "Yes." Elijah said to him, "Say, every day, Hear, O Israel, God our Lord, God is One." The child said, "Be silent, do not mention the name of God which my father and mother had not taught." He then brought out the statue of his deity from his bosom, and embraced it and kissed it until his abdomen burst. He fell on his deity to fulfill, "I will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols."
