 Still, how could Rava say this? It contradicts the earlier, more authoritative teaching of Rabbi Meir, who asked, why did the Torah have to say "food tree" when talking about the laws of trees in Israel? - To include trees whose wood and fruit taste the same, and what is it? - Pepper! Parenthetically, it tells you that the Land of Israel lacks nothing. So pepper is edible!? - Rava was talking about dried pepper, and Rabbi Meir - about fresh one.
