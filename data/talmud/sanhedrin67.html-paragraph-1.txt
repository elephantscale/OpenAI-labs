 If he says his words to two persons, they are his witnesses, even without a warning, and they bring him to court and stone him. If he says his remarks to one person, that person can entrap him, saying "I have more friends who are interested." If the instigator is clever and refuses, they arrange witnesses behind a partition and he asks the instigator to repeat his words in private. He then says, "How can we forget our God in Heaven and worship wood and stones?" If the instigator retracts, this is good, but if not, the witnesses behind the partition take him to court.
