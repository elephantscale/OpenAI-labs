 Once the groom marries his wife under the huppah, he alone, not her father, has veto power for her vows. What if he is supposed to make a wedding feast but delays it. He is already obligated in her support, so maybe he can annul the vows - or perhaps since he is not fully married, he cannot? - This question is also not resolved because related rules can be interpreted as supporting or disproving this fact.
