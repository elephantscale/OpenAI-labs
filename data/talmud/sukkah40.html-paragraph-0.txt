Sukkah 40 - What is the difference between the palm branch and a citron? Our last rule said that the etrog (citron) is a fruit and is subject to the laws of the Shmita year, but that lulav (palm branch) did not have this problem. But why? If etrog is subject to Shmita, so should be the lulav! Well, lulav did not begin growing in the fifteen days between Rosh HaShanah and Sukkot, when Shmita really started. But then the same can be said about the etrog! - No, the difference is that for palm tree, its Shmita starts when it is planted - which is before Shmita, but for etrog - at the time of picking it, which is on Shmita.
