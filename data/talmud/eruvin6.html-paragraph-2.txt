 What happens if the alley bends at ninety degrees in the middle? One can say that it is not open, but rather ends in another alley. This is the point of view of Rav, and one can carry in the alley fixed with a beam. Or one can say that it is simply a bent alley, open on both sides, and it is like a street. This is the point of view of Shmuel.
