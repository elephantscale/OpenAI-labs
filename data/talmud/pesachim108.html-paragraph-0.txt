Pesachim 108 - Drinking wine and eating matzah At the Seder, one will drink four cups of wine and eat good quantities of matzah. To prepare for this, Rabbah would drink wine all day. Rava, his student, explained: "How do we know that wine makes one hungry? - There is a rule that one can drink more between the first two cups of wine, should he so desire. If wine makes one satiated, this should not have been allowed, for he would not eat matzah with appetite. It must be that wine makes one hungry."
