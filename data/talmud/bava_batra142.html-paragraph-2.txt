 But what about a contradicting rule that "A one-year-old baby inherits and bequeaths", from which we understand that a fetus does not inherit? That rule is talking about a different situation - an inheritance that passes to the baby from his mother, and from him - to his paternal brothers. This type of inheritance cannot pass through an unborn child.
