Bava Kamma 27 - Liability of Two People Killing a Child If one threw a child off the top of a roof and another met the falling child with an upturned sword, Rabbi Yehudah ben Betaira says that the one wielding the sword is liable to execution because he hastened the death of the child, but the Rabbis absolve him, because the child is considered partly dead. They argue if "all human life" means any or all of it.
