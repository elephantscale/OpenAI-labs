 So far, we have never considered what the bride replies to the groom's claims. Let's look at this situation: the groom says he did not find her a virgin. She explains that true, she was not, but that was because she was violated while being engaged to him, and thus he still owes her the amount of Ketubah if she becomes divorced or widowed, and this is a case of "your (buyer's) field became inundated," so it is his loss. He says that perhaps it is not so, but instead, she was not a virgin when she got engaged to him, so his marriage to her was a "mistaken buy," and he does not owe the amount of Ketubah.
