Bava Batra 162 - The Last Line in Any Legal Document is Ignored When witnesses sign on a document, they leave approximately one line of space between the text and their signatures, to insure that their signatures do not run into the text. There is therefore a concern that an unscrupulous individual might insert a bogus line of text into this space. To protect against this possibility, the Sages decreed that nothing is to be learned from the last line of a document, and any new information there is to be ignored. Therefore, the scribe uses the last line to superfluously restate the document's essential elements.
