 Agra said, "Fowl and cheese may be eaten one after the other in a carefree manner, without washing one's hands and without cleaning the mouth with food and drink." Rav Yitzchak visited Rav Ashi's home. They brought him cheese, and he ate it; they then brought domestic animal meat, and he ate it without washing his hands. They questioned his behavior, "Agra taught that fowl and cheese may be eaten in a carefree manner, but not any meat!?" He answered, "This applies only at night, but by day, when I can see that my hands are clean from cheese, no washing is required."
