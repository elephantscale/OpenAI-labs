Shevuot 36 - Oath of Deposit If a person in possession of someone else's money - either a deposit, a loan, a stolen article, or the like - swears that he does not have it, he has taken what is known as an oath of deposit. If he swore falsely and subsequently confesses his sin, he must repay the principal plus an additional fifth and bring a "guilt offering" sacrifice in the Temple.
