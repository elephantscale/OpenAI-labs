Chullin 91 - The Fight Between Jacob and Angel The prohibition of eating the sciatic sinew applies to the sinew of the right thigh and of the left thigh, but Rabbi Yehudah says that it applies to only one thigh, and logic dictates that it should be the right one. Is this the logic of the Torah or of the Sages? In other words, is Rabbi Yehudah certain that the Torah prohibited only the right sinew, or is he uncertain which one is prohibited, and so both are prohibited out of doubt?
