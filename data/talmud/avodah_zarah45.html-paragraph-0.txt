Avodah Zarah 45 - Worshipping Mountains and Hills If a non-Jew worships mountains and hills, these mountains and hills remain permitted for benefit. The same is true when a Jew worships them, but the ruling follows the language of the Torah describing idol worship. However, the adornments of silver and gold on them become prohibited.
