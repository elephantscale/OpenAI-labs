Megillah 32 - After reading the Torah After they have read the Torah in the synagogue - which was done by calling multiple people - they call another person to raise the Torah scroll, for all to see, and then to "dress it up" - that it, to put the cover on it. This person takes away the reward of all the previous ones. How could it be? - The Talmud likes to emphasize things. Rather, his reward is equal to all of the previous ones combined.
