Sotah 3 - Is jealousy good or bad? Previously we learned that a man can warn his wife not to conceal herself with a particular fellow. Is that jealousy good or bad? Some say it is forbidden for a man to warn his wife this way. He should always try to maintain peace. A warning of this sort will lead to strife between the husband and wife or a conflict between her and her neighbors. Others say jealousy is caused by the spirit of purity and is good.
