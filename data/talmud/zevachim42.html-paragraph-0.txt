Zevachim 42 - Ruining an Offering with Half of its "Permitter" A "permitter" is the key service that allows the offering to be eaten. In the case of an animal offering its "permitter" is throwing its blood on the Altar. In the case of a flour offering the "permitter" is burning a handful of its flour together with oil and frankincense included in it, on the Altar. Some say that the wrong intention during half of the "permitter" already rejects the offering, and some say that it does not.
