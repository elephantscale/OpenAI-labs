 The rising of the sun spread behind the clouds is compared to the antlers of a morning hind. On that subject, why was Ester compared to hind? - Just as a hind has a narrow womb and is desirable to her mate every time as the first one, so was Ester desirable to the king Ahasuerus. And so are the words of the Torah always beloved to those who learn them. And just as the antlers always grow, so too the prayers of the righteous become stronger as they persist in them.
