What can Rabbi Elazar answer to the verse used by Rabbi Yochanan? He agrees that it is better to do everything at once, but if the Priest did it in halves, this is also valid. But the Torah uses the word "statute," which means to be observed precisely?! - The Priest brings the complete amount from his home, but then can divide it.
