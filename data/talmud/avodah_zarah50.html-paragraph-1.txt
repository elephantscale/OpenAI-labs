 What is the law in regard to the stones found in the vicinity of, but unattached to, a Markulis? Rabbi Yishmael says that three stones found one next to another are forbidden - because they represent a miniature Markulis - but two are permitted. The Sages, however, say that the idol worshippers do not make miniature Markulis, rather, those stones that appear to be with it are forbidden, others are permitted.
