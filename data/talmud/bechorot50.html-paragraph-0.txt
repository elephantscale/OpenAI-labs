Bechorot 50 - Shekel, Selah, and Other Currencies The amount given to a Kohen to redeem the firstborn son is "five shekels by the sanctuary standard, where the shekel is 20 gerah." In the times of the Second Temple the names of the coins changed. Since a common payment was a half-shekel, donated yearly by each Jew to the Temple for atonement sacrifices, this half-shekel was called a "shekel," and the full shekel was instead called a "selah". That is why our ruling was formulated in terms of "shekel by the sanctuary standard," and not just a "shekel."
