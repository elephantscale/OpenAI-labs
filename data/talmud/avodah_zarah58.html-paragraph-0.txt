Avodah Zarah 58 - Two Contradictory Rulings about Wine, Both Correct Rabbi Yochanan ben Arza and Rabbi Yose ben Nehorai were sitting and drinking wine. A waiter, whom they took to be a Jew, came by, and they asked him to pour them a drink. After he poured the wine into theirs cups, it transpired that he was an idol worshipper. One of the Rabbis ruled the wine prohibited even for benefit, while the other one ruled it permitted even for drinking.
