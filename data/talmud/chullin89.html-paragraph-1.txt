 The sciatic sinew, "gid hanasheh," is prohibited by the Torah on the account of the angel fighting with Jacob and striking him on the hip, dislocating his thighbone. The Torah says, "Therefore, the Children of Israel are not to eat the displaced sinew that is in the spoon of the thigh, to this day." The "spoon" is the rounded, spoon-like flesh around the top of the thighbone.
