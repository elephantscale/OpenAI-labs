Nazir 3 - Proximity search If a person says, "I take on myself an obligation to bring birds (sacrifice)," - this also serves as a declaration that he is becoming a nazir. Since talking about Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel says that "His hair has grown like the feathers of an eagle" the person does a mental proximity search and, finding the two words "hair" and "eagle" (bird) close, he means the hair of a nazir when he refers to birds - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that he is not a nazir because people do not do such proximity searches in their heads.
