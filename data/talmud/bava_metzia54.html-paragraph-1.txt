 When one redeems the second tithe taken from his produce for money, he needs to add 1/5. There are many other cases where 1/5 is added, such as redeeming property belonging to the Temple treasury or reapying a Kohen's portion (trumah) that one has accidentally eaten. Is the 1/5 calculated on the principal ("from the inside) or on the principal plus the addition ("from the outside")?
