Yevamot 59 - Wife for a High Priest A High Priest has stricter requirements in the choice of this wife than a regular Kohen: not only he cannot marry a divorcee, but he can also not marry a widow, whether she was only engaged or actually married, or a mature girl. The Torah said, "He will take a wife in her virginity." This is to emphasize initial virginity, at the age between twelve to twelve-and-half. However, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon allow him to marry a girl older that that.
