Bava Kamma 16 - Usual and Unusual Damagers The final decision is that half-damages are a penalty. Thus if a dog killed and ate sheep or a cat killed and ate a chicken, it is a case of unusual damage, and it is not collected in court. This however only applies to large animals, but small animals are "tooth" damage and it can be collected.
