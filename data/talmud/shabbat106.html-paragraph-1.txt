 Trapping an animal constitutes hunting, and that is prohibited on Shabbat. But what is trapping? - If one drives a bird into a cage or a deer into courtyard - in other words, if he makes the animal sufficiently trapped so that he can catch it in one attempt.

Therefore, a smaller than usual enclosure would make it trapped.
