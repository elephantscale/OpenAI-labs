 Rabbi Shimon says that the Kohanim take the possession of the field without a payment, because it is similar to the two lambs of Shavuot, about which the Torah also said "holy," and which belong to the Kohanim without a payment. And Rabbi Yehudah? - Better to compare consecrated field to a house - both are real estate. And Rabbi Shimon? - Better to compare field to a sacrifice - both are presents to Kohanim.
