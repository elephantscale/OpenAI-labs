Nazir 29 - Father and son, a nazir We said that a father can pronounce his son a nazir. This can only be true if the son is not grown up because the father would have no rights over his son's religious observances after that. Only if the son is young and the father feels that this would be a proper measure for his son's education could such a law be possible.
