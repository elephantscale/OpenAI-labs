 If the brother violated this decree and performed chalitzah earlier, and then it was found out that the widow was pregnant - which means that the brother did not die childless -- then the chalitzah was meaningless. As a result, he is still allowed to marry the widow's relatives - because he was never connected to her. Likewise, she is permitted to marry his relatives: a valid chalitzah is considered a divorce, thus forbidding her to marry his relatives, but this chalitzah is considered nothing. She is not a divorcee and can even marry a Kohen.
