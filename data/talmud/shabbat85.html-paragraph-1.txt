 "Gives forth" denotes one species, "its plant" is another, "its seeds" implies two, for the total of four, and "to sprout" is the fifth. The Talmud gives multiple possible layouts for seed planting, as well as derives that the size of the patch is indeed six by six hand-breadths, and that it is situated in a barren area, for otherwise other seeds would impede the planting of the five species inside.
