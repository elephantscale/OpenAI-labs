Shabbat 134 - Washing the baby In the time of the Talmud it was customary to bathe the infant in hot water, before and after the circumcision, and failure to do so was considered potentially dangerous to the infant's life. Therefore, the Sages permitted washing the baby with hot water, even though normally this is forbidden. Some say that even if the water was warmed on Shabbat itself, the washing is still permitted. However, it has to be done in an unusual manner, by splashing the water with a hand. Even pouring it from a vessel is not considered a sufficient deviation.
