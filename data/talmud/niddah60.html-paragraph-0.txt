Niddah 60 - Woman Borrows a Tunic If a Jewish woman lent her tunic to a gentile woman, or if she lent it to a Jewess who was a niddah at this time, and when she got the tunic back and wore it herself, she afterwards discovered a bloodstain on it, she may attribute this stain to that other woman she lent it to. The other woman does not loose anything thereby: if she already was a niddah, this does not change her status, and if she was a gentile, who does not observe these laws, the Sages presumed that she is a niddah at all times.
