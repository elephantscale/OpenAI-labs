Zevachim 119 - The Resting Place and the Inheritance Moses said that there will be periods when private altars will be permitted, "for you have not yet come to the resting place or to the inheritance." The "resting place" refers to Shiloh, and "the inheritance" refers to Jerusalem. When the Tabernacle stood either in Shiloh or Jerusalem, private altars were forbidden. However, before that, at Gilgal, and between these time period, when it stood in Nov and Giveon, private altars were permitted.
