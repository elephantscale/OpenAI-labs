 However, Shmuel could not understand his reason: if all roofs are one area, what does it matter if the people made an eruv (common food) or not? Rav Chisda explained that either position has its problems. If we always allow carrying things in the courtyard, just like Shmuel said, people will be utterly confused: things that started Shabbat in a courtyard can be carried to another courtyard, but things that originally were in a house cannot!? Now different things have different laws for carrying!
