Shabbat 21 - Oils unusable on Shabbat Having discussed the wicks that don't make a good light on Shabbat, we now turn to oils that are not drawn after the wick and that are therefore prohibited for Shabbat use. The first one is the "kik" oil. What is it? Shmuel said, "I asked all the seafarers, and they told me that there is a bird found in seaport cities, and its name is 'kik', and it is oil made of that bird." Rabbi Yitzhak said that it is cottonseed oil, but Resh Lakish maintains that it is oil of the tree under which the prophet Jonah rested, called "kikayon." Rabbah bar bar Channah said, "I myself have seen Jonah's plant, and it grows in ponds, merchants hang it above their stores' entrances, its seeds produce oil, and under its branches rest all the sick of the Land of Israel."
