Chullin 64 - The Eggs If an idolater sells eggs, one can buy them and not be concerned that they come from birds that are nevelah or terefah. But let's be concerned that they come from a non-kosher bird altogether! - We are dealing with the case where he says which kosher bird they come from, and in additional they have the kosher signs. What are these signs? They are spherical and rounded, though not a perfect sphere, with one of its ends rounded and one tapered. Then why can't we rely on these signs alone? - Because there are crow's eggs that look kosher.
