Brachot 38 - Bread and vegetables Before eating bread, one washes his hands, then says "Blessed is the One Who brings forth (ha-motzi) bread from the ground." However, Rabbi Nechemyah says that the proper form is "motzi," not "ha-motzi". What is their argument? All agree that "motzi" means "Who brings forth," and that it works. However, the Sages say that even "ha-motzi" also means that, whereas Rabbi Nechemyah says that it refers only to the future, as in "God, Who brings them forth from Egypt" - and that promise was given when the Exodus was only in the future.
