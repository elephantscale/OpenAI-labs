 Rav Chisda said, "An uninterpreted dream is like an unread letter." He also said, "Neither a positive dream is fulfilled entirely, nor a negative one; in every dream there are false elements, just as there is straw with grain. When one sees a negative dream, its sadness is sufficient, and no more bad things will happen of those foretold in a dream, and for a positive dream - its joy is its own reward."
