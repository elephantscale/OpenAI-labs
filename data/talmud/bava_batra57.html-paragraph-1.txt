 These activities do not establish chazakah: if a person would place an animal in a courtyard belonging to someone else; if he would place an oven, millstones, or a stove in the courtyard; if he would raise a chicken or deposit his manure there. The property owner can claim that he saw no harm in allowing these items to remain.
