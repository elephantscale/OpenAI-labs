Zevachim 76 - A Leniency That Leads to a Stringency If a guilt-offering became intermingled with a peace offering, then we have a problem that the guilt-offering bears more limitations, even though their blood services are equivalent. Rabbi Shimon suggests that we can still resolve the situation by bringing both in the north (which will work for both types of sacrifices) and eating them according to the stringencies of the guilt-offering. We will have brought the offerings right away.
