Sanhedrin 14 - The Decapitation of the Calf If the body of a murder victim is discovered outside a town in the Land of Israel and it is not known who killed him, the town nearest to where the body was found has to take a calf that was never worked and bring it to a valley of unworked ground, where it is decapitated.
