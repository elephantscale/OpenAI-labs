 If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat," and then he ate prohibited foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes - he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him, because he swore to something to which he is already obligated, and his new oath did not take effect.
