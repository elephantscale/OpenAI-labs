Temurah 3 - Questions About Sacrifice Exchange We can ask a few questions regarding sacrifice exchanges. Can a minor effect an exchange? If he is younger than twelve, there is not doubt that he cannot, because he cannot vow. But between twelve and thirteen his vows take effect. On the other hand, a minor is not punished, and since he cannot receive lashes, possibly he cannot effect exchange? We leave it unresolved.
