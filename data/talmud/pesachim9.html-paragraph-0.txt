Pesachim 9 - Weasel drags bread from house to house After one searches his home for chametz, he does not have to worry that perhaps a weasel will now bring bread from another house. The same is true of one's room: once it is searched, one need not think that a weasel might bring it there from another room. This is true because if one is to be concerned, he would have to suspect that a weasel brought it from another courtyard or another town, and there would be no end to his worries.
