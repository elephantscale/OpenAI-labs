 Levy went to ask in the Academy. They told him, "Does it say that she shall remove the shoe with her hand? - No! So she can do it with her teeth. Furthermore, does it say that she spits with a spit? - No, it just says that she spits, in any manner." Regarding the last question, the wording is given the appellation of "truthful" when accompanied by an oath and cannot be changed. The Talmud then discusses when a Heavenly decree can be reversed and when it cannot.
