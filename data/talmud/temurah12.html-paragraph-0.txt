Temurah 12 - When Calculations Determine The Law If one accidentally dropped grain of the Kohen's portion (terumah) into regular grain, all of the grain becomes forbidden for anyone but a Kohen to eat. However, if the amount of the kohen's portion grain was less than 1% of the regular grain, the terumah is nullified, and the complete mixture is permitted. What happens when the terumah was not nullified, and some of the mixture fell into another pile of grain? We calculate the percentage of the initial terumah portion in comparison to the total, and this gives us a leniency. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees. According to the him, the complete forbidden mixture acquires the status of terumah, with the full power to prohibit the grain it falls into.
