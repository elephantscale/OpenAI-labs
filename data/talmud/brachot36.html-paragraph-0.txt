Brachot 36 - The special blessing for wine The more specific one is in praising God, the better, and for wine one says a special blessing, "Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the vine." Why is this so? On olive oil, for example, one does not say a special blessing, but rather the same blessing as on the olive itself?! This is because wine gladdens the heart. If wine is so important, let's give it a complete Grace after meals, just like one says after bread! - No, people's meal centers around bread, but it does not centers around wine. Rav Nachman asked Rava, "What if one made wine the center of his meal, does he say a complete Grace afterwards?" Rava answered: "When Elijah comes, he will answer you, but for now, since most people don't consider wine a bone-fide meal, his intention is unimportant compared to the majority."
