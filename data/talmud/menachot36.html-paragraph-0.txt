Menachot 36 - When to Put on Tefillin The proper time to don tefillin is the first light of dawn. If one rose earlier than that, to go out on the road, and did not want to carry the tefillin in his hands, lest they become lost, he can don them immediately. When the prescribed time comes - that is, when he is able to recognize a friend at a distance of four steps - he should touch them and then recite the blessing.
