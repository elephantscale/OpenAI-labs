Brachot 37 - Blessing for pepper On peppercorn (really spicy ones, not those that are eaten plain and note those that are eaten as vegetables) - Rav Sheshet says that the blessing is a generic blessing on food, "Blessed is the One by Whose word everything was created," but Rava says that there is no blessing at all. How could they argue, peppercorns are a great food!? - They are talking about dried-out peppercorns. Rav Sheshet says that since dried peppercorns are worse than the original ones, they loose their blessing of "Blessed is the One Who created the fruit of the earth" and get a generic blessing instead. Rava, however, does not consider them food altogether. This is in fact consistent with Rava's point of view, since he said that one who chews and swallows peppercorn and ginger on Yom Kippur is exempt.
