Furthermore, he can tell others, "Come and save food for yourself," and if they are wise, they will make a reckoning with him after Shabbat, for their wages as laborers saving his food. Why do they need to make a reckoning?! He said, "Save for yourself," so it is their food now! - They are righteous, and will not keep the food.

We said that they were wise, not righteous, and they know that since he did not promise them money for sure, this is not considered Shabbat wages.
