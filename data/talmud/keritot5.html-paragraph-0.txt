Keritot 5 - Anointing Oil The anointing oil was made from a combination of olive oil and spices. It was used to consecrate the Kohanim and the articles used in Temple service. The Torah said, "Take the finest fragrances: 500 shekels of distilled myrrh, â€¦ one who blends a similar formula, or places it on an unauthorized person, he shall be cut off spiritually from his people." However, if one prepared the anointing oil to learn how it is to be done, or to present it to the community for their use, he is exempt. Likely it is even allowed in the first place.
