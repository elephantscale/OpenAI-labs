 When Rav dies, his students accompanied him to the cemetery. On the way back, they said, "Let's go and have a meal on the bank of the Danak River." After they have eaten, without quite sitting down, they did not know if they ate as a group. Rav Ada bar Ahavah stood up, turned his garment front-to-back, and tore an additional tear on it, as a sign of further mourning. He said, "Rav just died, and we already forgot the laws of the meal!" Finally a certain old man came and taught them the above rules, that even if they said "Let's go eat at a certain place," they are already considered a company.
