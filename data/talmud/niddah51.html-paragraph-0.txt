Niddah 51 - One but Not the Other - Wool and Plants Any time that one has to give a present of wool (the first of the fleece) to the Kohen, one also has to give other gifts, that is, foreleg, jaws, and abomasum to the Kohen. However, when one slaughters a cow, he has to give the gifts but there is no fleece.
