 However, is that even true? After all, the laws of Nazir are an unusual innovation not found in other parts of the Torah. What is unusual? - The fact that one can complete his vow of a Nazir by offering only one of the three required sacrifices; is not ideal, but acceptable. You might have thought that just as the laws of a Nazir are more lenient here, so too they are more forgiving in regards to the "Do not delay" requirement. For that, we have to rely on the rule of similarity: vows and Nazir are similar; as such, all laws of vows apply to the Nazir.
