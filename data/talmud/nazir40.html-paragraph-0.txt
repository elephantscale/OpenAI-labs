Nazir 40 - Real shaving is done with a razor The Torah said about a nazir that a "razor shall not pass over his head." However, the words "razor" or really "no razor" is already sufficient for us to know the law. Then why are the words "will not pass over his head" written at all? - to include any other way of hair removal, such as pincers or depilatory, and to make it prohibited for nazir to remove his hair in any way.
