 What happens if one does offer an offering from leaven and from honey on the Altar? Rava says that he incurs four sets of lashes, one for leaven, one for honey, one for mixtures of leaven, and one for mixtures of honey. However, Abaye says that he incurs no lashes at all, since one never incurs lashes for violating a generalized prohibition. In this case, generalized prohibition means that the Torah stated two preconditions, "any leaven and any honey," and concluded with one prohibition, "do not offer." Some say, however, that at least one set of lashes he does incur.
