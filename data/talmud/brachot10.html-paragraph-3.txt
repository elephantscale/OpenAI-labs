 Certain people in the neighborhoud of Rabbi Meir caused him considerable distress, and he wanted to pray that they should die. His wife Beruriah stopped him: "Does it say 'The sinners will be no more'? - No! 'The sins should be no more.' Pray that they should improve their ways!" He did, and they improved.
