 Rav forbids it: since in the future the wine will be worth much more, it resembles "reward for waiting," or interest. Shmuel permits it: sometimes a misfortune can befall the vineyard, and the reduced price is on account of accepting risk.

But Rav agrees to Shmuel where harvesting is done with the aid of oxen, because of the high risk to the oxen.
