Shabbat 30 - The book of Ecclesiastes One should not fashion a Shabbat lamp with an additional supply of oil dripping from a perforated eggshell, since he could be tempted to use this oil, thus indirectly extinguishing the lamp. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that people will be careful and not draw oil from the eggshell, so the decree is not needed. Everybody agrees that if the eggshell is part of the lamp, putting oil in it is allowed, since people will then definitely know not to take oil from there.
