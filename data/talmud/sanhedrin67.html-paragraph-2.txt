 A person named Yannai asked for a drink at a certain inn. He saw that the waitress's lips were moving and understood that she was engaged in sorcery. He poured off some liquid, and it turned into scorpions. He gave the waitress to drink and she became a donkey. He rode upon her and went out to the marketplace. Her friend came and dissolved the magic spell, and Yannai was thus seen riding upon a woman in the marketplace.
