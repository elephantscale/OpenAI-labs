Chullin 39 - Shechitah for the Sake of an Idolater If an idolater asks a Jew to perform shechitah to the idolater's animal, the shechitah is valid. Rabbi Eliezer declares the meat forbidden. According to Rabbi Eliezer, the unspoken thought of an idolater is to dedicate the animal for his idol. Therefore, even if he sells the animal to the Jew but keeps a small part for the himself, the complete animal is prohibited. Actually, the first teacher agrees that the intent of the idolater takes effect, only the first teacher requires that it be spoken, and according to Rabbi Eliezer, even the thought is sufficient, and we can even assume that thought.
