 If he cannot go there on Friday to establish his eruv, he can send a messenger. However, if this messenger is a deaf-mute or deranged person, his eruv won't be valid, because they do not have the necessary understanding of the matter. On the other hand, if the deranged person only transports his eruv, but a sound-minded person accepts it there, it is valid.
