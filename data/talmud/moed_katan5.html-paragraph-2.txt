 The markers were made at some distance from the grave. It helped the passers-by not step on the place of ritual impurity. However, the grave markers were not placed too far to not take away from the land where one can travel safely. Cemeteries need not be marked because their boundaries were obvious. Alleys leading to them might be labeled since occasionally people could be on the way to bury their dead, run out of time, due either to nightfall or to the approach of Shabbat, and bury the dead in such an alley.
