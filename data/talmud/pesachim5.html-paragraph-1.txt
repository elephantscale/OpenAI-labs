 The Torah said, "For seven days, chametz should not be found in your homes." However, it also said, "But on the first day, you should destroy chametz." What is there to destroy if, on the first day, you can't even find it? Therefore, it must be that by "first day" in this context, the Torah means "prior" day. Very well, but if so, it should be the whole day!? - that is the meaning of the word "but," which comes to limit the new rule, and it is logical to limit it to a half-day. Thus, the clear result: chametz is prohibited for eating after midday before Passover, but the more serious consequence of being cut off from one's people for one who eats chametz - that starts only when the Passover really begins.
