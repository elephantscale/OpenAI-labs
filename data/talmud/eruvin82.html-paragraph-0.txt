Eruvin 82 - Communal residence area We already saw a number of times that each person is given a limit of how far he can walk on Shabbat, and that is usually two thousand steps from his residence. If one wants to change this limit, he can place food some distance away from his residence, and this then becomes the center of his new residence area. The residence area (techum) is rectangular, measured from his city, from his house, or from his place if he is not in a house or a city.
