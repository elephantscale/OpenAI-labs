Sukkah 7 - Two walls and a half The sukkah is a temporary dwelling, and it only needs three walls. The third wall can be as small as one handbreadth. How do we know this? The words "sukkot" - meaning multiple sukkahs, are mentioned three times in the Torah. In two cases, the letter "o" (vav) is missing! This gives us a count of sukkahs (2), plus sukkah (1), plus another sukkah (1), a total of four. However, the first mention is needed for the simple meaning of the word - to live in a sukkah. Thus, we have a hint that a sukkah needs to have only three walls. In addition, we have another rule that God taught to Moses - that the third wall can be as narrow as a handbreadth.
