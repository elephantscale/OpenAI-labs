 Three times a year the olives are harvested, and in each harvest three grades of oil are extracted. For the first harvest one picks the crop from the top of the olive tree. He then pounds the olives in a mortar and puts them inside the basket. He then presses the olives with the beams to extract more oil. Finally, he grinds the olives with millstones and again presses them with a beam to extract yet more oil. The first oil is valid for the Menorah, and the other oils are valid for flour offerings. For the second crop he collects the olives from the rooftops of the nearby houses, and for the third one he collects the remaining olives in a vat.
