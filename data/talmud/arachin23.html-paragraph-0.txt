Arachin 23 - Responsibilities of a Loan Guarantor A Ketubah is a husband's obligation to provide for his wife in case of his death or divorce. If one consecrated all of his possessions to the Temple, the Ketubah part is not consecrated, because it came prior. However, if the husband now wants to divorce his wife, we make him vow never to re-marry her, because we suspect that the divorce is just a ruse: she will collect the Ketubah, and he will re-marry her and live on that money - this is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says that he does not need to vow - either because people do not cheat on Temple, or because he can annul his consecration.
