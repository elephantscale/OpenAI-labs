Chullin 77 - Amniotic Sac If one slaughters an animal and finds inside an amniotic sac, one he is not squeamish can eat it, because the Torah permitted it with the phrase "Every animal (even an amniotic sac)... you may eat." However, it is not really food, and therefore it does not carry the ritual impurity of foods. When one planned to eat it, this thought elevates it to the status of food, and now it can carry ritual impurity.
