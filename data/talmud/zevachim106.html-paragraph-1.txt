 If one slaughtered and burned a sacrifice outside the Temple, he is liable for slaughtering it, and he is liable for burning it as well. Rabbi Yose HaGlili says: "If he slaughtered the sacrifices inside the Temple, so that it was indeed valid, and then burned it outside, then he is liable for burning. But if he slaughtered it outside, then it became invalid right away, and he is not liable if he then burns it."
