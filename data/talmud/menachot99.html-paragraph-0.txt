Menachot 99 - We Raise in Holiness but Never Bring Down King Solomon added ten tables and ten menorahs in the Temple. However, they put bread only on the one table that Moses had made, and lighted only one menorah. Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua says that they used all the tables, since it says "The tables with the bread upon them." How does the other teacher explain the plural "tables?" He says that they always used three tables anyway: the breads were prepared on a silver table, then they were placed in the Holy of Holies on a golden table, and after they were removed from there, they were put on a third table, also of gold.
