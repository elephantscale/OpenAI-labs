Taanit 24 - Prayer and the natural order of things Rabbi Mani was a student of Rabbi Yitzhak ben Eliyashiv. Once Rabbi Mani complained that his wife's family members were wealthy, haughty, and mistreated him. "Let them become poor," said Rabbi Yitzhak, and they became poor. Rabbi Mani complained that they were forcing him to work, and Rabbi Yitzchak said, "Let them become rich again," and they become wealthy. Rabbi Mani also mentioned that his wife was homely. "What is her name?" asked Rabbi Yitchak. - "Channa." "Let Channa become beautiful," - said Rabbi Yitzhak. And she became beautiful. But now, she became haughty and ruled over Rabbi Mani, so Rabbi Yitzhak said, "Let Channa return to her homeliness." Later, students of Rabbi Yitzhak asked to pray so that they would become extra bright. He answered, "I don't do such things any longer."
