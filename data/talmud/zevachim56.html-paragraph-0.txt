Zevachim 56 - The Area for Slaughter, the Time for Blood Peace offerings had to be slaughtered after the doors of the Temple Hall were opened; if they were slaughtered before that time, they were invalid, since the Torah said, "And he shall slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of the Meeting" - at the time when one can enter, not when it is locked.
