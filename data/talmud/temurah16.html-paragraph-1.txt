 Nevertheless, this time Otniel ben Kenaz restored them through logic. That is the meaning of the phrase, "Otniel ben Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, conquered Kiryat Sefer (City of the Book), so Caleb gave him Achsah, Caleb's daughter, as a wife." Why was she called Achsah (anger)? - Because she was so beautiful (and some say, so modest) that everyone who looked at her immediately became angered at his wife who lacked in comparison. Being married to a Torah scholar who spent all his time in studies, Achsah had nothing in her house. She went to her father, saying, "You have given me an arid land," that is, devoid of all worldly goods. He gave her upper and lower springs. That means that he said, "One to whom belong all the mysteries of the world, the upper and lower, need not ask me for sustenance." Rather, to him applies the verse from the Proverbs, "She (the Torah) is like a merchant's ships, from afar she brings her sustenance."
