 Even if a snake coiled around his heel, he should not interrupt his prayer. That is true, however, only of a snake that is not likely to bite. There was once a creature called "arod," a mixture of a snake and a lizard, who was hurting people. They told Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa about it, and he came and put his heel over its burrow. The arod bit Rabbi Chanina and died. At this time they said, "Woe to a man who meets an arod, but woe to an arod who meets Rabbi Chanina." Rabbi Chanina then put the dead arod on his shoulders and brought it to school, saying, "It's not the arod that kills, but it's the person's imperfections that do."
