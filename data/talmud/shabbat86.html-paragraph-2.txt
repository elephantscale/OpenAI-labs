 Actually, a person right out of the mikveh is considered pure, with a tinge of impurity until sunset. Still, it could have been enough for giving the Torah. Why, for example, was the Torah not given on Friday, right after everyone went to a mikveh? - Because God did not want to do it in secret at night. Then why was the mikveh time not set for Saturday morning, with the Torah given right after that? - Because then some would be returning from the mikveh, with others just going there, and the Jewish people needed a complete unity.
