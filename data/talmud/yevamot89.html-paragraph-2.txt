 But take a similar case where she only got engaged, not married to the second husband - there she can return to the first husband, and the Get from the second one is not required. Why not!? - People might also make a mistake and think that one can remarry his wife after she was divorced and married to someone in the interim. That, actually, is a reasonable objection. However, the fine distinction is that where she was only engaged - no transgression took place - and although people might make a mistake, the Sages did not penalize her; where she got married, they lived together unlawfully, and they did impose a penalty.
