 In general, if one comes and says that he wishes to convert and become Jewish, they tell him that he is joining a persecuted and pursued people, and if he still persists, they begin the process right away. They also say to him about a few of the mitzvot that he will have to keep and inform him of the seriousness of the prohibitions of Shabbat and the like. However, they also tell him about rewards in the World to Come. Finally, they inform him that he will have to give charity, and in Israel of the tithes that he will have to give. However, they don't overwhelm him with stringencies, as is learned from the behavior of Naomi toward Ruth, a righteous convert.
