 Ravina said that "all" refers to those who take upon themselves to do shechitah, because most of them know the laws - provided that they already did shechitah a few times without fainting. Even if it is their first time and they do shechitah without supervision - which they should not have done - if they later say that they did not faint, their slaughter is valid.
