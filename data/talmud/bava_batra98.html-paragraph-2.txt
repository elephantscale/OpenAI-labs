 Incidentally this ruling teaches that it is not proper for a son-in-law to live in the house of his father-in-law. Rather, the father of the groom would usually build a small annex adjoining his own house, where the newly wed couple could live. This accords with the teaching from the book of Ben Sira: "Lighter than bran is the son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law's house. Still lighter is a guest who invites another guest. And lighter yet is one who gives an answer before he has heard the question."
