 God also gets angry every day, as in psalms, "God is angered every day," for a moment ("rega") that lasts a quarter of a second. Bilam knew how to pronounce a curse at exactly this moment. The sign of this moment is a rooster standing on one foot, with a pale comb. Rabbi Yehoshua once took a rooster and tied him to his bed, in order to curse someone who was harassing him. However, when the time came, he dozed of, and said, "We see from here that it is not proper to curse, since 'God's mercy is on all his creations'."
