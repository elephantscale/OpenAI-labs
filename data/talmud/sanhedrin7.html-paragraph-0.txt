Sanhedrin 7 - Common Wisdom and Torah Rav Huna said, "Discord is comparable to a channel from an overflowing river - once it starts, it will continue to widen" - as in Proverbs, "The opening of a channel is a beginning of a discord." Abaye Kashisha said, "Discord is like a plank in a bridge: once people walk on it, it becomes firm and stays firm."
