 For example, when an ignorant farmer brings oil or wine for his sacrifices, they are accepted, even though the vessels in which he brings them are most likely ritually impure. The law is lifted for the following reason: if the ignorant were excluded, they might build their own Temple. There was also a hope that they will be influence by the Temple's holiness for the good. This, however, is a loophole, and to avail of it, the consecration of the wine or oil must occur before the pressing, since this leads the farmer to purify his vessels first.
