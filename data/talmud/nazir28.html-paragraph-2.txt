 Rabbi Meir says that even if she did everything right, he can stop it at the last moment - because he can claim, "I don't want my wife to shave off her hair!" (which every nazir finally does). And the first teacher, what did he think? - That she can wear a wig. And Rabbi Meir? - That the husband won't like the wig.
