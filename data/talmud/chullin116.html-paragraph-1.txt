 The rennet of an animal of an idolater and of an animal that died of itself (nevelah) is prohibited for consumption. If one curdles milk with the meat of the abomasum and there is enough meat to impart flavor to the cheese, the cheese is prohibited. If a terefah animal suckled from a kosher animal, its rennet is permitted, because it is merely gathered in its innards.
