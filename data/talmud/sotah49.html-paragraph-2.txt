 After Rabbi Yehudah the Prince died, there was no more humility and fear of sin. However, when this teaching was recited in his academy, Rav Yosef corrected the students and told them that there was still genuine humility because he was there. Similarly, Rav Nachman said to take out "no fear of sin" since he was yet alive.
