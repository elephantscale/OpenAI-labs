Pesachim 118 - Cups three and four The third and fourth cups of wine complete the Seder. He uses the third to enhance the blessing after the meal and the fourth - to finish praises. If he wants to drink more wine - it is OK at the beginning of the meal, but between the third and the fourth cups, he should not drink, lest he becomes inebriated (since he is not eating any longer), and not complete the praises.
