Sanhedrin 15 - Appraisals Produce grown in the Land of Israel must have tithes separated from it, with the second tithe taken to Jerusalem and consumed there. If one wants to redeem it for money, and if its value is not known, three people are required to estimate it. Three merchant appraisers are required for this, and they can even be partners.
