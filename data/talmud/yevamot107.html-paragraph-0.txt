Yevamot 107 - Underage wife People lived short lives, and their next day was uncertain, so early engagement and marriage were critical. The Torah provides legal authority for the father of a girl to give her away in marriage before she reaches maturity. However, if the father was not alive, getting married was a problem: the underage girl lacked legal authority to accept an engagement for herself. In her family, the Torah gave this authority only to her father. Therefore, the Sages instituted for the mother and the girl's brothers to arrange her marriage. Yet, the legal basis for this marriage lay in the authority of the Sages and not in the Torah. It could be dissolved by the girl deciding that she does not like her husband and does not want to continue the marriage. This is called a "miyun" or "refusal." How exactly does this happen?
