Niddah 45 - Ages of Legal Responsibility A father has the authority to betroth his daughter when she is a minor. The preferred way is for the girl to grow up and decide on her own, but this legal right gives her father a way to arrange the marriage early, which in view of persecutions and short lifespan was often beneficial. Thus, a minor girl may be legally considered a married woman, even while she continues to live with her family until she grows up.
