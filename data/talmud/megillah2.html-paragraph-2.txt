 Here, "To establish these days of Purim in their times," and the words "their times" indicate multiple days. "Their" gives two days, and "times" gives another two days. But we need five days total! That is because the thirteenth is when everybody came together to defend themselves, and it does not require a particular word to be added to the times of reading the Megillah. The Talmud quotes another phrase as the source and explains why these two opposing points of view do not agree.
