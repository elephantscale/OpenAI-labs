Bava Batra 175 - Loans and Liens One who loans money to his fellow and records the loan in a document signed by witnesses may collect even from encumbered properties. The existence of the document, together with the witnesses, make the loan public knowledge. Thus, potential buyers can investigate and find out about the lien created by this loan. Therefore, they accept the risk. Should the borrower later default on the loan, the lender can collect the land from these buyers. Even if the document does not mention the lien, it is assumed to be the omission made by the scribe, and the lien is still presumed.
