 What is the rationale for the opinion of Rabbi Yose? There is in fact a disagreement as to where exactly the Altar stood in the Courtyard, and Rabbi Yose is of the opinion that it stood completely in the north. If so, let Rabbi Yose say this directly, why did he use the words "as if it were slaughtered in the north?" Rabbi Yose wants to pre-empt your question, for you might say, that since the Torah requires "at the side of the Altar," then perhaps on top of the Altar is not valid - and Rabbi Yose tells you that nevertheless it is valid.
