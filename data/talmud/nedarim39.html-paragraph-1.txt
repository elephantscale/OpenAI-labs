 If one vows against a fellow, he may still visit him if the fellow gets sick, but he should stand and not sit. What are we talking about? If the visitor is prohibited from benefiting the sick one, then the visitor should be allowed to sit: he is doing a mitzvah. And suppose the visitor is prohibited from receiving benefits from the visitor. In that case, no visits should be allowed since the visitor inevitably derives some benefit by entering the house, which is more protected than being in the street!?
