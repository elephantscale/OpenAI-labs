 If the original owner merely tells two witnesses, "So-and-so is a thief," this is not an effective protest. If, however, he says, "So-and-so is a thief, for he has taken possession of my land through an act of theft and tomorrow I shall claim it from him in court," this is an effective protest. The threat to sue is not really necessary, but this is how people usually conclude their protest.
