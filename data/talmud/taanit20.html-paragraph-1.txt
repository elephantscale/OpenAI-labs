 However, on other occasions, Rav Yehudah found good signs within bad ones. For example, "Jerusalem will be like a widow." - but not really a widow, rather, like a woman whose husband went overseas but plans to come back. Another case: prophet Achiya cursed Israel that God would smite it like a reed. And yet, reeds straighten out after a storm. On the other hand, Bilam blessed them to be like a tall cedar that withstands a strong wind. A strong wind - yes, but not a hurricane when cedar becomes uprooted. Thus, it is better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar. Moreover, the reed merited that a pen is made from it.
