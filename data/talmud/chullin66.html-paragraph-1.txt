 Any fish that has a scale certainly has a fin. If so, why did the Torah list both? - To make it abundantly clear for those who don't know the Torah that well. Furthermore, the Torah said "Those that have fins and scales in the seas and rivers you may eat, and those that don't have the fins and scales in the seas and rivers you may not eat." Why is this repetition? - To make one who eats fish without fins and scales transgress both a positive and a negative commandment.
