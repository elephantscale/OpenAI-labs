 Plimo asked Rabbi Yehudah the Prince a question, "One with two heads, on which of them does he don tefillin?" Rabbi Yehudah was indignant. At this moment a man came in and said, "A child with two heads was born to my wife. How much money do I need to pay to a kohen to redeem the child?" Elijah the Prophet came and gave an answer: "Ten coins, twice the amount, since the Torah counted people by the head."
