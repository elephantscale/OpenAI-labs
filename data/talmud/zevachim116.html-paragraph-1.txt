 Could the sacrifices brought on private altar be eaten as peace-offerings, or did they have to be burned, as burnt-offerings? Those who say that they could be eaten point out that "Abel brought from the firstlings of his flock and from their fats..." - that is, he brought the fats but ate the rest. And those who say that Abel brought only burnt-offerings explain that he brought the fattest of the lambs and burned them completely.
