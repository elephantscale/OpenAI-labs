 The barley (omer) offering was brought from new barley on the second day of Passover, which in Israel is the first intermediate day of the holiday, when work is allowed. The offering consisted of an one-tenth of an ephah measure (about 50 pounds), and thus amounted to 5 pounds. Actually, a complete ephah was harvested, ground, and sieved thirteen times, to produce the required one-tenth.
