 Another groom came to Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince's son, claiming that he did not find blood. Rabban Gamliel examined the cloth he wiped himself with and, after washing, found blood there. Yet another groom came to Rabbi Yehudah and claimed that he did not find blood, while his wife claimed that she was a virgin at the time of marriage. Rabbi Yehudah saw that their faces were dark from malnutrition, so he commanded his servants to take them into a bathhouse to be bathed, make a feast for them, and bring them into a room. They now found blood, and Rabbi Yehudah congratulated them. He applied to them a phrase from Lamentations, "their skin cleaved to their bones and became dry as wood."
