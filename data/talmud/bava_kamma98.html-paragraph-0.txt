Bava Kamma 98 - Does Burning the Mortgage Cancel the Loan? If one knocks the coin out of his fellow's hand, and the coin falls into the sea, but it is possible to retrieve it, he can say, "There's your coin, go get it" and not be liable. Similarly, one who burns a loan document of his fellow, so that the loan can't be collected, is not liable to pay, for he says to his fellow "I burned a mere paper of yours." In both of these cases the damages are not direct but causative, for which one doesn't pay.
