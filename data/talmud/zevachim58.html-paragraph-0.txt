Zevachim 58 - Sacrifice at the Top of the Altar The correct place to slaughter the most holy offerings is in the northern part of the Courtyard. However, what would happen if a sacrifice were to be slaughtered on the actual top of the Altar? Rabbi Yose says that the sacrifice is valid as if it were slaughtered in the north of the Courtyard. Rabbi Yose ben Yehudah says that from the middle of the Altar and southward is the same as the south of the Courtyard, and from the middle and northward is the same as the north of the Courtyard.
