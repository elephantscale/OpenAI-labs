 However, a Heavenly angel disagrees, for once an angel encountered Rav Ketina wearing a linen garment without a blue thread in tzitzit - following the opinion that this is not needed. Angel said, "Ketina, Ketina, since you wear linen in the summer and a woolen cloak with rounded corners in the winter, what will become of the mitzvah to have a tzitzit with blue threads?" Rav Ketina said to him, "Do you then punish for failure to fulfill a positive commandment?" The angel said, "At the time of anger, yes."
