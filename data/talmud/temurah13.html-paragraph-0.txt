Temurah 13 - No Exchanges For Birds And Flour Birds and flour offering cannot make an exchange, that is, if one says, "Let this bird be a substitute for that bird which is a sacrifice," his words have no effect whatsoever. The Torah said, "If one does substitute an animal..." - only animals are included in this law, but not birds, and not flour.
