 If blood was found on his cloth, then she indisputably had blood during cohabitation, and each one is now obligated in a sin-offering. Regarding her cloth, there are three time periods. If blood was found on her cloth immediately after cohabitation, both need a sacrifice. If it was found after a time (enough to reach under a pillow and pull out a cloth), both bring an offering of uncertainty. If it was found after that, there is not more consequence than making the foods that she touched ritually impure retroactively.
