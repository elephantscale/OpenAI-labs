Pesachim 50 - Customs In the Temple's times, people did not work on the day before Passover: this was a day of bringing a Passover sacrifice, and it had a character of a holiday. Later, some people adopted a custom to refrain from work on this day, while others did not. Therefore, if one is from a town where they work on this day, and he comes to a town where they don't - he, too, should not do any work. In general, one should follow the local custom to avoid disagreements. Moreover, if he comes from a town with a more stringent custom, he is bound by it too. Therefore, one receives the stringencies of the place he left and the stringencies of the place he came to.
