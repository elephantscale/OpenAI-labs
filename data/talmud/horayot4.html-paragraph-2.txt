 The court needs to forget only part of the law, but not the complete law. For example, if they ruled that there is no Shabbat in the Torah, they are exempt from the bull offering, but if they said, "There is Shabbat in the Torah, but one is allowed to carry things from one's house into the street," - then they are liable to a communal-error bull offering.
