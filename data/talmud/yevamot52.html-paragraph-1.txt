 If one stated that he would marry the widow (this is called "maamar" and looks like an engagement) and then cohabited with her - this is the proper way of doing the mitzvah of yibum. Now, that's obvious, isn't it? You might think that since this procedure looks completely like marriage, people may think it is actually a traditional marriage and not a yibum. Therefore, we need to be told that this is the proper order and that people will understand. Note that in practice today, yibum is never done, but rather one performs the chalitzah.
