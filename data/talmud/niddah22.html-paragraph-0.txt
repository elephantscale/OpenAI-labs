Niddah 22 - Hair If a woman expels objects resembling a rind, a hair, dust, or midges, all of red color, there is not question that these items are not embryos or fetuses. Therefore she is definitely not impure with the impurity of childbirth. However, these items may be coagulated menstrual blood, and then she would be impure with the regular impurity of a niddah.
