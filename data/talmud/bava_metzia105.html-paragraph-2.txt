 If a sharecropper leased a field from his fellow and it did not produce a substantial crop, so that he wants to abandon working the field, if there is enough growing in it to produce a heap, he is obligated to care for it. Rabbi Yehudah says, "What kind of limit is a heap? Rather if there is enough for sowing the field again."
