 Was the techum area square or round? Rabbi Chanina ben Antignos says that it was round. What about the cities of the Levites, whose area around was square? - He notes that the Torah says "This will be or them the area around," and explains, "This for them" but not this for others. And the other teacher? He understands it, "Like this, for them and for others."
