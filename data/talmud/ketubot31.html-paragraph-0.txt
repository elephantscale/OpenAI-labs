Ketubot 31 - Stealing on Shabbat Previously we mentioned that if one violates a girl for relations with whom he is liable with his soul, then only this punishment applies. He does not have to pay the penalty of fifty shekalim. However, the prototypical example of this is found on Shabbat, when one steals a purse from a house and then carries it into the street. Since for carrying the load into the street on Shabbat, he is liable to death by the Court, he does not have to pay the penalty for stealing and only has to return the stolen goods. This will apply even if he is not executed, such as if there were no witnesses or no proper warning.
