Bava Metzia 21 - Lost Objects that the Finder May Keep When an object without an identifying mark is lost, the owner despairs of recovering it, because he knows that even if it is found, he will be unable to prove that it is his. Therefore the following objects belong to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in a public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, baker's loaves.
