 A law about marrying only on Wednesdays does not apply today. Even back when it did, people might be prevented by an unavoidable circumstance and get married earlier, such as Monday. What unavoidable circumstance could that be? Imagine that the mother of the bride or the father of the groom dies just before the wedding - and the feast is already prepared. In that case, they do not delay the wedding but rather delay the burial. All the time the parent is not buried, his children are not considered mourners. Thus, they can proceed with the wedding, consummate the marriage, and then the groom (if it was his father who died) observes the seven days of mourning.
