Yoma 85 - For what does Yom Kippur forgive? Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement. It is a means to achieve a clean slate. Other means for it are listed below. If one does something listed as "Don't do it" in the Torah, and that is also qualified as "his soul will be cut off from the people" - then, if he did it inadvertently, he brings an offering in the Temple and is forgiven. When there is no Temple, his repentance is enough, and he is completely forgiven on Yom Kippur. If it is a regular "Do it" or "Don't do it," and he violates it, then his repentance is effective right away, even before Yom Kippur. If he tries to use this rule to his advantage and says, "I will do the wrong thing, but I will then repent," - a chance to repent may not happen. The above is true only in regards to himself. However, if he wrongs his fellow man, Yom Kippur does not atone until he pacifies his fellow. Art: After the Misdeed by Jean Beraud
