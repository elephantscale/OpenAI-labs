Chullin 75 - Calf of a Slaughtered Cow: Disagreements and Final Law Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish further disagree about the calf of the slaughtered pregnant cow. If its mother became ritually impure, is the calf considered part of her, with the same impurity as her, or is it an independent being simply touching her, which results in less impurity? Further, that fat which normally goes on the Altar and is thus prohibited for consumption in the case of other animals, is it considered permitted meat in the case of the calf, since all of it is permitted?
