 We see thus that one can use sign, or omens, to influence his luck. For example, if one wants to know if his business venture will succeed, he can raise a rooster (who is quick and industrious), and raise him for the sake of his venture; if it grows plump and fine, he will know that he is likely to succeed. In the same vein, one should be accustomed to eat at the beginning of new year (Rosh HaShanah) a gourd, fenugreek, leek, beets, and dates, because these grow speedily and some are particularly sweet.
