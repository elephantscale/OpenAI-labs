 A Jewish ruler (Exilarch) n Babylonia came to the city of Hagronia and lectured there. All the Sages came to his lecture, except Ravina. Since Ravina may have offended the Exilarch, Rafram came to exonerate him and asked him why he missed the lecture. Ravina answered that his foot was hurting. "Then you should have put on a shoe!" - "It was the top of the foot." "Then you should use a (loose) sandal!" - To this Ravina answered, "There was a pool there, and it is preferable not to cross a pool in a sandal on Shabbat."
