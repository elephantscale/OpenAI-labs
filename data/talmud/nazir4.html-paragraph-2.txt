 One can become a "nazir like Samson" or even just a "permanent nazir." The permanent nazir observes the laws of wine, ritual impurity, and not cutting hair all his life. However, if his hair is too heavy, he can trim it - and bring sacrifices - then continue. "Nazir like Samson" cannot cut his hair at all, but on the other hand, he is not bringing sacrifice even if he becomes impure - he just purifies himself and continues. Others say that "Nazir like Samson" does not exist - because Samson never became a nazir himself.
