Pesachim 73 - A destroyer on Shabbat If people cannot eat the Passover offering's meat, and one slaughters the sheep for them, his act makes the sacrifice invalid. We had this rule earlier. If he, moreover, does this on Shabbat, he is liable for a sin-offering. However, what did he do? There is a view that one who acts destructively on Shabbat does not violate Shabbat. Only constructive acts count. If so, why is he bringing a sin-offering?
