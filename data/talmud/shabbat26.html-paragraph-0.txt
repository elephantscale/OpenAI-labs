Shabbat 26 - Oils for Shabbat lamp Although Rabbi Ishmael prohibits using the malodorous oily residue of pitch ("itran") - out of fear that one may not be able to stand the smell and leave the room, which would diminish the honor due to Shabbat - the Sages allow all oils for the Shabbat lamp. This includes sesame oil, nut oil, radish oil, fish oil, watermelon oil, the aforementioned "itran", and naphtha, another derivative of pitch.
