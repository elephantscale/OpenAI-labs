Kiddushin 82 - Conclusion Rabbi Meir says: "One should always teach his son a clean and easy trade, and he should pray to He to Whom all wealth and possessions belong, because there is no trade that does not include indigence and wealth. For poverty is not the result of a trade, nor is wealth the result of a trade; rather, all is in accordance with one's merit."
