Pesachim 32 - Eating priest's chametz If a wall fell on one's chametz and buried it, he is not required to dig after it to destroy it. However, he still needs to renounce it in his heart - lest it becomes uncovered during Passover and he will want it. How deep does it have to be buried? - So that a dog cannot dig it out. And how deep is that? - Three handbreadths.
