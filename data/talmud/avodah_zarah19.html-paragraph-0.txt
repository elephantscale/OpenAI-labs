Avodah Zarah 19 - Learning Torah From Many Teachers The first psalm says, "But his desire is in the Torah of God..." to teach us that one should study that area of the Torah which his heart currently desires. Two students of Rabbi Yehudah the Prince wanted to study different subjects, Levi - Proverbs, and Rabbi Shimon - Psalms. They prevailed over Levi to study Psalms, but once they learned "...but his desire is in the Torah of God..." - Levi said, "You taught me the permission to go back to Proverbs."
