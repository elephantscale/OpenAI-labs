 One should bless God for the bad things in the same vein as he blesses for the good, by saying "Blessed be the true judge," since all comes from God. However, we know this already! - This ruling is taught here for an additional lesson: even if some good can come of it later, right now it is bad. For example, if one's field is flooded, then, even though later it may result in increased productivity for the field, right now he says "Blessed be the true judge."
