Bava Metzia 7 - Two People Found a Document If two persons, a creditor and a debtor, appear in court holding on to a note of indebtedness, and the creditor says, "It is mine: it fell from me and I subsequently found it," but the debtor says, "It was indeed yours, however I repaid the debt to you," - then the witnesses who appear on the document must certify that the document is indeed authentic, and they divide it with an oath, just like in the case of a garment.
