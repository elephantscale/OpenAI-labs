Zevachim 52 - The Base of the Altar The base of the Altar was a protrusion at its bottom, a step, one ell (about 2 feet) high and one ell wide. It ran around the Altar, except its eastern side. The blood of burnt offerings was thrown on this base, that is, on its top flat part, or above it, on the Altar's wall. How do we know this?
