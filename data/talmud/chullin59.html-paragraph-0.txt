Chullin 59 - Which Animals Are Kosher? If an animal inhaled smoke, was overcome by cold, or ate animal poison - all of which are dangerous to animals but not to humans - it is kosher. If it ate human poison or if it was bit by a snake, it is still kosher, but it is prohibited to eat it because of a potential danger to human life.
