Menachot 81 - Thanksgiving Offering from Tithe If one said, "Let this animal be an exchange for my thanksgiving," both animals are now sanctified. If one of them dies, the other one cannot be brought: if the live one is the thanksgiving, it needs breads, and if it is the exchange, it does not need bread. The students throughout time made eight attempts to resolve this problem and find the way to bring the animal. At fourth attempt by Levy, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince remarked, "This one looks like he has no brains in his head," which was perfectly in order, since the students deduced laws even from Rabbi Yehudah's tone of answers.
