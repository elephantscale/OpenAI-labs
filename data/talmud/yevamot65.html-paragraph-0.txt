Yevamot 65 - Claiming a refund If a woman was married to someone for ten years and divorced because she had no children, then she is entitled to the full Ketubah (divorce settlement) because it is presumed that it is the husband's fault, as we learned before. If that happens the second time, then on the third time, the presumption changes, and, since three times is considered an established rule, she is established as not being able to have children. The third husband can divorce her without a Ketubah payment. Can the previous husband now claim a refund of his earlier Ketubah payment? No, for she can claim, "It is only now that I have grown weak, but it was your fault before."
