 Women residing in Arabia often wore headcloths that would wrap their head; though unusual, it is a garment, and therefore may be worn on Shabbat. Similarly, Median women used to fasten their cloaks with stones; normally considered "muktzeh", set aside from use on Shabbat, a stone is allowed as part of clothing. In fact, this all is allowed for any person, but the rulings are given in terms of prevalent custom.
