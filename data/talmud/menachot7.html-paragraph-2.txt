 Resuming the narrative, Rav Nachman met Avimi and asked him, "How does one do kemitzah, separation of a handful of flour?" Avimi answered, "Like from this vessel," pointing to the vessel on the ground. "Even on the ground?" - asked Rav Nachman. Avimi said, "No, I meant that another Kohen holds the vessel up." "Then you need three Kohanim, one to hold the vessel, one to separate the handful, and one more to receive the handful into another vessel," - said Rav Nachman. "Yes, even thirteen, if need be," - answered Avimi.
