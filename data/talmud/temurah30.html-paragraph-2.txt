 As we learned, animals that were worshipped or sodomized are prohibited for the Altar. However, their offspring are permitted. That is true only if they were first sodomized - which made them prohibited - and then they conceived, and the offspring is a mixture of the prohibited mother and permitted animal father. If they first conceived and then were sodomized, then Rabbi Eliezer says that the offspring are also prohibited, because it is considered as part of the mother, and was as if sodomized with the mother.
