Yevamot 52 - Get, Yibum, Chalitzah What are the possible permutations of marriages and divorces and yibum and chalitzah? If one declared the intent to marry his deceased brother's wife but then changed his mind and gave her a Get (divorce document), the Get alone is not enough. The Torah law dictates either a yibum or a chalitzah in this case. Therefore, he needs to also give her a chalitzah.
