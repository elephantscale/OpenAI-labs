 If, while being transported, the coins were lost or stolen, the agents who transported them would have to take an oath that they have not been negligent - and then they would be free of the obligation to pay. But, to whom do they swear? If money to buy sacrifices in the Temple has already been separated, then the condition was that the money on the way would also be included. Thus, in this case, the money was considered in possession of the Temple, and the agents would swear to the Temple's treasurer. However, if the accident happened before the money was separated, the agents would swear to the townspeople - and the townspeople would have to undertake another collection.
