 Even though a first-born animal is given over to a Kohen and is his property, the Kohen cannot make exchange for it. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri asked, "Why not?" Rabbi Akiva explained, "They are like all other sacrifices." Rabbi Yochanan objected, "But a first-born is his property!" Rabbi Akiva replied, "When did the first-born become sanctified? When it was born, in the house of its owner! It and its exchange must be in the same domain, but now it is in the hand of the Kohen, thus exchange is not possible."
