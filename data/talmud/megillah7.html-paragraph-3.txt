 One must get so drunk on Purim as not to know the difference between the evil Haman and the righteous Mordechai. Rabbah invited Rav Zeira to a Purim feast, and when they were drunk, he slew Rav Zeira. The next day he prayed for mercy, and Rav Zeira came back to life. Next year, though, Rav Zeira declined the invitation, saying, "A miracle does not occur every time."
