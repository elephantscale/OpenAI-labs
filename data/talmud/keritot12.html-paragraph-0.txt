Keritot 12 - Witnesses Tell Him That He Inadvertently Ate Forbidden Fat If one witness tells somebody, "You ate forbidden fat," and the man remains silent, he has to bring a sin-offering. However, if he denies it, he is not liable. If two witnesses tell a man that he ate forbidden fat, and he denies it, then Rabbi Meir holds him liable, but the Sages exempt him.
