 One can do a single act of cohabitation and be liable for six sin-offerings: if he cohabits with his daughter, who is his sister, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, a married woman, and was not in a mikva. How is that possible? He had an incestuous relationship with his mother, from which a daughter was born. The daughter married his (paternal) brother. After her husband died, this daughter married his father's brother. He then had committed incest with her, without her going to the mikva.
