 Rabbi Yehudah the Prince answered, "Great question! But I will answer either way: if the blood is still valid, the garment needs laundering, and if it is invalid, then I follow Rabbi Akiva to say that since it was valid at some time, it still makes the garment liable to laundering." However, in truth the law is not like Rabbi Akiva, and thus Levi's inquiry remains unresolved.
