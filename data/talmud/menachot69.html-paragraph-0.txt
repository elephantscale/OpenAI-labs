Menachot 69 - Barley Permits for People, Wheat - for the Temple The barley offering (Omer) permitted new grain for consumption by people, but in the Temple the new grain was not used until they brought the two loaves of wheat on Shavuot. Nevertheless, since new grain was already permitted to people, if they brought it in the Temple before Shavuot, the offering was valid.
