Temurah 20 - Guilt Offering Can Be Only A Male Animal Since guilt offering can only be a male, if one consecrates a female animal for this purpose, his consecration is invalid. Nevertheless, the animal's value does become consecrated, and this consecration spreads throughout the body of the animal. It cannot be brought on the Altar, but one has to let it graze until it gets a blemish, then sell it, and bring another, male animal for one's guilt offering. If meanwhile he already brought his guilt offering, this money is put into a collection box in the Temple, to buy sacrifices for the time when the Altar is idle.
