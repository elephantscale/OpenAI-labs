 However, we have the following a forteriori (kav vachomer) argument. "...and any daughter who inherits a legacy from the tribes of the children of Israel..." is talking about the inheritance coming to a daughter from her mother. Now, the daughter does not inherit from her father, and nevertheless inherits from her mother. The son, who inherits from his father, surely inherits from his father, and even preempts the daughter.
