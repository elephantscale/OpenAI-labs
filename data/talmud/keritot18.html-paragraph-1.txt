 When is this relevant? Consider the following situation. If there were two pieces of fat, and a Jew came along and ate the first one, and then an idolater came and ate the second one, the Jew is liable to an offering of uncertainty. If two Jews each ate a piece, then they tell to the second, "Please bring an offering of uncertainty, for otherwise your fellow will have to bring a sin-offering." Who could have authored this rule? Only Rabbi Eliezer, who allows a voluntary offering of uncertainty.
