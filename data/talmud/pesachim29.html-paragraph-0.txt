Pesachim 29 - Eating chametz of the Temple On the previous page, we had a rule about chametz after Passover - that if it had belonged to a Jew on Passover, then it was now prohibited - but we could not find a source for it. Now the Talmud says that it could have many sources. It could be the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who, although strict, interprets the law of "not seeing chametz in your dwelling" as telling us that your chametz cannot be seen, but non-Jewish chametz and chametz of the Temple can be seen. It could also be the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: even though the chametz after Passover is not prohibited, it could be that the Sages added a penalty and prohibited it nevertheless.
