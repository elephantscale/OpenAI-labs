Nedarim 2 - What is a vow? A man can vow against eating meat, for example, and then he will become liable for eating it as if it were non-kosher. He can use the words, "I am making a vow (neder)," but he can also say, "This is prohibited to me as a sacrifice ("korban"). He can use a synonym, such as "konam" instead of a "korban." Finally, he can say an incomplete vow, such as "I am separated from you" or "I am distanced from you," and as a result, he will not be able to derive any benefit from his fellow who was the subject of his vow.
