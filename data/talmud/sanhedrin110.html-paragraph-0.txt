Sanhedrin 110 - Not to Persist in Quarrel "A wise woman builds her house" - this is the wife of On son of Pelet, who advised her husband to disassociate from Korach, then sat at the entrance to his tent, making sure they don't call him. "...but the foolish one destroys it with her own hands" - this is the wife of Korach, who instigated her husband to quarrel against Moses. Therefore, the commandment "don't be like Korach" teaches that one should not persist in quarrel.
