 Continuing with the customs that one should observe together with the local residents, in some places, there was a custom to abstain from work on Tisha B'Av, to concentrate on mourning, and if this is the custom, one should follow it. Only distracting labor requiring significant exertion is forbidden. If the place does not have such a custom - this is valid also. However, the Sages should abstain from work on Tisha B'Av regardless of the local custom because they should feel the Temple loss more keenly than the rest.
