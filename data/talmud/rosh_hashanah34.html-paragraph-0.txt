Rosh Hashanah 34 - How important is the shofar? If one heard the nine required sounds of the shofar in nine hours, one sound an hour, he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation. There is no requirement for them to be adjacent to each other. However, if he heard them simultaneously from nine people, he has not fulfilled his obligation because he could not hear each sound clearly.
