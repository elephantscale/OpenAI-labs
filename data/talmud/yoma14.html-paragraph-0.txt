Yoma 14 - What does the High Priest do for seven days? Normally the High Priest is not doing regular services. However, on Yom Kippur, he will be performing them all by himself, so for the seven days of sequestration, he practices these services daily: he throws the blood of the sacrifices, burns the incense, prepares the lamps, and offers the head and the hind leg of the daily offering.
