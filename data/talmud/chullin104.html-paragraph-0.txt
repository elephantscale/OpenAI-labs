Chullin 104 - Meat Cooked in Milk The Torah said, "You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk." Since it repeated this again and again, then only only cooking, but eating such mixture or selling it is also prohibited. At this the Torah prohibition stops. For example, eating cold meat with cold milk would be allowed. However, the Sages extended the prohibition with safeguards. Thus the rule: all kinds of meat should not be cooked with milk, except for the meat of fish and locusts. It is also forbidden to serve meat and milk or cheese on the table together.
