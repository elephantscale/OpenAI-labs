 There was a bird named Chol (possibly Phoenix) which Noah found lying in its quarters in the Ark, not outside waiting for food. He asked, "You don't want to eat?" The bird answered, "I saw how preoccupied you were, so I did not want to trouble you with feeding me." Touched, Noah said, "May be it God's will that you will never die!" and it was fulfilled in "I shall die with my nest intact and live for many days like chol."
