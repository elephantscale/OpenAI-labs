 What do the Sages answer to Rabbi Meir's incident? - They say it was a miracle anyway and cannot serve as a basis for legal rulings. Why do they call it a miracle? If it is because he did not eat for three days - Esther and the whole Jewish people fasted for three days and survived. Instead, it is because he did not sleep for three days, which is impossible. And Rabbi Meir? - He leaned upon the arches that were inside the cistern and slept. And the Sages? - The arches were of marble, and he would have slipped and fallen. And Rabbi Meir? - He would wake up before falling. Thus, each can defend his point of view.
