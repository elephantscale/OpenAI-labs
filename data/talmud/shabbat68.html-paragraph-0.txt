Shabbat 68 - A "major" rule about Shabbat The Sages stated a major rule about Shabbat: "Anyone who forgets the essence of Shabbat and consequently performs multiple labors and violates the Shabbat many times on multiple weeks - when he realizes that it was wrong, he has to bring only one sacrifice, collectively for all violations." Why is this so? Since some phrases of the Torah refer to single sacrifice, and some - to multiple ones, it is entirely logical to say that when there exists one root cause for all his violations - forgetting that there is a prohibition to do work on Shabbat in the Torah - that is the case where one sacrifice is brought.
