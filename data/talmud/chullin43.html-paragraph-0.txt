Chullin 43 - Seven Teachings of Terefah There were seven more signs of terefah. They included the teaching of Rav Matna about the ball of the thighbone that popped out of its place in the socket, the teaching of Rachish bar Pappa about an animal that became diseased in one kidney, and so on. However, how could they change the classical number of the eighteen cases? They did not, rather, those who teach those seven rules combine all cases of punctured organs into one, and then add the seven.
