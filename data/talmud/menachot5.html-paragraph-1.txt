 What happens if a kohen takes off a handful of this barley sacrifice thinking that it is some other offering? Resh Lakish says that is valid, and the handful can be burned on the Altar, but he has to bring another barley offering. How could he say that? If a new offering is required, that means that the first one was invalid. How can one bring it on the Altar?
