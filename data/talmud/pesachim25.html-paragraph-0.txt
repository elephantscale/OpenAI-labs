Pesachim 25 - Three important things Even when eating prohibited foods, one is only liable to punishment if he does it in the normal way people eat - these are the words of Rabbi Abahu. What would be an example? - If he takes that fat that is to be burned on the Altar and swallows it raw instead. A stricter version of this teaching prohibits even that and allows only an unusual manner of benefiting, such as putting this fat on a wound with medicinal purposes.
