Avodah Zarah 35 - Real Reason for Prohibiting Cheese of Idol Worshippers If one betroths a woman using the waste of an ox that is stoned - for example, because it was sodomized - the betrothal is valid, but if he uses the waste of calves sacrificed for idolatry, the betrothal is invalid. Why? Regarding calves sacrificed for idolatry, the fatter it is the better, and the owner is pleased with the waste expanding its size. With an ox that was stoned, the owner does not care if it is fat or not, and the waste is not part of it.
