Rosh Hashanah 9 - A Jubilee year There is a Jubilee year at the end of every seventh Shmita year (every 49 years). What day does it start on? - First of Tishrei, which thus becomes the New Year for the Jubilee. Jewish slaves must be set free; any land bought in the last 49 years goes back to its ancestral owners; this is also a Shmita year when nobody works the land. The sign of all of this is the blowing of the Shofar at the end of Yom Kippur. Therefore, for the ten days between the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, slaves cannot go home yet, but they are already not slaves. Instead, they eat and drink and sit with their crowns (or turbans, a sign of a free man), and their masters now serve them.
