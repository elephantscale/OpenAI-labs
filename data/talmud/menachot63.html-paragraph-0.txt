Menachot 63 -Fried and Baked Flour Offerings Fried flour offerings were prepared either in a deep pan or in a flat pan. The latter was a griddle with only a slight lip around it. Rabbi Yose HaGlili says that the difference between the deep and flat offering is that the first one has a cover, but Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel says that the cover has nothing to do with it, but that the offering prepared in a deep pan is soft and it quivers, whereas the one prepared in a shallow pan is thin and hard.
