 Measures (size of the wine cup, amount of matzah, amount of vegetables, etc.) play an important role in the Seder and other areas. There are two ways to specify them: one based on geometry (such as the volume of a mikvah measured as three cubic "ama" - elbow), and another based on volume (egg volume, olive volume, etc.) One would expect these two ways to agree, but in the eighteenth century, Rabbi Yechezkel Landau measured egg volumes and found a discrepancy by the factor of two. Either the people or the eggs must have changed, which leaves us with two estimates for each given measure.
