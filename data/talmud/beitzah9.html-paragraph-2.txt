 Rav Chanan further qualifies this disagreement: it is only a ladder in the street that they argue about, but if nobody sees him in the privacy of his home, then it should be allowed by everybody. But how can Rav Chanan say so? We know that there is a rule that "Whatever the Sages prohibited to do in public, because of what an onlooker might think, is equally prohibited inside his most private room!?" - It turns out that not everybody agrees to this rule, and Rav Chanan thus has his source. Furthermore, this rule only applies when it looks like he may be violating a Torah prohibition, but when an onlooker may think that he is violating a rule of the Sages - that is allowed in private.
