 The best rams came from Moav, lambs from Hebron, calves from Sharon. Rabbi Yehudah says that the best lambs are those whose height is like their width. Rava bar Rav Shila explained this with the phrase "your livestock will graze on that day, a broad lamb." He also said that God posted angels around the walls, whose task was to remind Him about Jerusalem. And what did these angels say before destruction? "God chose Zion, desired it for His dwelling."
