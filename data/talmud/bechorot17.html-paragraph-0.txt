Bechorot 17 - How Many Generations of Firstborn Exemptions? Previously we learned that when a Jew accepts from an idolater sheep valued at a fixed sum, with the arrangement of sharing in the offspring, the offspring are exempt from the laws of the firstborn. Rav Huna understands this to mean only the next generation, but Rav Yehudah says that the next two generations are exempt, because this is how far the lien extends. They derive their respective views from the analysis of the dissenting opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who says that all generations are exempt.
