Chullin 25 - What is Fit for One is Unfit for Another What is pure in the case of earthenware utensils is impure in the case of all other utensils, and vice versa. If a dead lizard is inside a clay pot, even not touching it, the pot is impure, but if it touches the outside, the pot remains pure. The opposite is true of other utensils.
