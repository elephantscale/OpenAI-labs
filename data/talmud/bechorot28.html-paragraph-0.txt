Bechorot 28 - When Must the Firstborn Animal Be Eaten? The firstborn must be eaten "year by year". What does this mean? If a firstborn was born blemished, it does not have the full holiness of the firstborn and therefore is allowed to be eaten. In that case it must be slaughtered and eaten within a year from its birth.
