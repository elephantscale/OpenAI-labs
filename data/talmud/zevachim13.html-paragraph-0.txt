Zevachim 13 - Errors on Other Steps of the Sacrificial Service We have learned before that slaughtering a Passover sacrifice or a sin-offering not for their sake makes them invalid. Now we learn that it is true not only for slaughter, but also for the other three steps of the sacrificial service: receiving the blood in the Temple vessel, walking with that blood to the Altar, and throwing it on the Altar. If any of these steps are done with the intention for a different sacrifice type, this makes the sacrifice invalid.
