 If one tried to make a sacrifice exchange but did not use the right term, for example, if he said, "Let this be deconsecrated onto that," the exchange does not take place. However, if deconsecration was possible, such as when it was a sacrifice with a blemish, he effected the redemption. The new animal is consecrated, and if it is less expensive than the original one, he must add his money.
