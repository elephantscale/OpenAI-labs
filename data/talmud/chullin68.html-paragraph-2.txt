 The foreleg that was put forth is prohibited because of the phrase "and meat in the field, terefah, you will not eat." The words "in the field" are extra, since a predator can attack anywhere, and it teaches an additional lesson: once meat has gone outside of its bounds (its mother's womb), it becomes forbidden. The Talmud started this topic because of its connection to the laws of terefah discussed earlier.
