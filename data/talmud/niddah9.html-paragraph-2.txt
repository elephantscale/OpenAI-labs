 An old woman is one whom they call "Mother so-and-so," and in today's terminology probably "Granny," and she is not embarrassed. Others say, until she does not resent it any longer. The difference between these two opinions is the time period when she does not resent it, because it's true, but is still embarrassed. The "old woman" of our ruling is one who is old as above, and then misses her three periods.
