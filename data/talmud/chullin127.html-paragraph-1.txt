If a limb or flesh is mostly severed from an animal but not completely, they are called "dangling." In this state, they are ready to receive the food impurity, however, as with all foods, they must first be "prepared" for it by becoming wet. If the animal is then slaughtered, the blood of the slaughtered is considered to have prepared them, even if it did not touch them.
