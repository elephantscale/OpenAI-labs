 If one says to a woman, "You are betrothed to me on condition that I will give you two hundred silver coins (about $10,000) - she is betrothed to him, provided that he pays. When he pays, she it betrothed to him retroactively from the first day. Therefore, if she accepted betrothal from someone else in the interim, it is void.
