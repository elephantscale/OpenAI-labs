 If the donor asked a third party to acquire the gift on behalf of the recipient, the acquisition act is valid, since it is assumed that most people do want gifts. If the recipient was at first silent and then protested, then some say that he acquired the gift, but some say that perhaps he saw no need to protest until the gift actually reaches his hands, and thus the situation is in doubt.
