Avodah Zarah 10 - Conversations Between Antoninus and Rabbi Yehudah the Prince Antoninus once told Rabbi Yehudah, "Roman dignitaries are persecuting me." Instead of answering, R. Yehudah would bring Antoninus into his garden daily, and would pluck a single radish from a bed in front of him. Antoninus said to himself, "R. Yehudah is advising me to kill them off one at a time."
