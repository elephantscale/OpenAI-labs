 Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa was once on the road, the rain came upon him, and he said, "Master of the Universe, the whole world is happy, but Chanina is sad," - and the rain stopped. When he reached home, he said, "Master of the Universe, shall the whole world be in distress and Chanina in comfort?" - and the rain came again. Rav Yosef noted, "What good did the prayer of the High Priest accomplish against Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa?"
