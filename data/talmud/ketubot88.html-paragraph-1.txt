 For example, say that the children of one family, after their father died, claim that the father of the other family (who also died) borrowed money from their father. The borrower's children say," "Our father told us that he indeed borrowed, but repaid" - the borrower's children must take an oath. This applies when their father says ""I paid"" for then the existence of the loan document does not prove anything.
