 One of the Temple's gates was called "The Water Gate," because, in the future, a spring of water will issue at this place from Jerusalem. The Talmud described how it will happen: from the Holy of Holies, the stream will be like the antennae of the smallest snail; then like locusts' antennae, and by the time it goes out and connects to the rivers, lakes, and seas of Israel, it will be so powerful that a mighty vessel won't cross it.
