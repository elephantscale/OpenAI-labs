 Earlier, we mentioned the five things that one is should abstain from on Yom Kippur: food, drink, washing, etc. Where does it say so in the Torah? - It could be that it is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but because the term "deprivation" is mentioned five times, the Sages decreed five deprivations that one should sustain. Food, however, is named explicitly, and drinking is included together with eating. How do we know this last fact? - Because Torah mentioned drinking wine and put it in the list of food items.
