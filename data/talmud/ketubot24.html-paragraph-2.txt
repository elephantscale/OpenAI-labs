 But is it true that Rabbi Yehudah suspects collusion? Didn't we learn this case: if two vendors of produce come to a town, and one of them says, "My produce is not properly tithed, however, his produce is" - we do not believe his testimony because we suspect that in the next town they will say the reverse, and this is a ploy to inspire credibility, and here Rabbi Yehudah permits to buy their produce. But he should suspect them and forbid it!
