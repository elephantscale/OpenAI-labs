 Still, on the subject of two blessings, the Talmud asks about the redemption of a firstborn. Here there are two blessings, "commanded us to redeem the firstborn sons" (by giving money to a Kohen) and "allowed us to live to this time." Rabbi Simai attended the first-born feast, and they asked him who says these blessings. Perhaps the Kohen, who gets the money, says "allowed us to live to this time?" Rabbi Simai did not know and went to ask in the study hall. They told him, "The father of the son who is being redeemed - he says both blessings."
