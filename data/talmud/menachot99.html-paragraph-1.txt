 Why was the third table made of gold? Because of the rule, "we raise in holiness but never bring down." What is the source for this rule? When Moses assembled the Tabernacle, he did it all by himself. Once the work was started by him, anyone else doing it would be considered a descent. But this only proves that we do not bring down, how do we know to elevate? Because the first set of Tablets which was broken was nevertheless also put in the Ark.
