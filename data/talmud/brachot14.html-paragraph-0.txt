Brachot 14 - Greeting a Fellow Before Morning Prayer If one accepts on himself a fast (besides those mandated by the Torah or by the Sages), can he taste food, if he does not swallow it? Did he accept to refrain from eating and drinking - and he is not eating in this case? Or did he accept not to have any benefit from food, and there is a little benefit here? Rabbi Ami answered, "He can taste, and there is no problem in that." From his reply we also understand that "in that" there is no problem, but he should not swallow, and no blessing is required. Some understand it differently and say that swallowing a small morsel is allowed.
