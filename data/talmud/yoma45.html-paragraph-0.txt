Yoma 45 - Two, three, or even four pyres on the Altar? The High Priest proceeds with the Yom Kippur service, which in some aspects differs from the daily one: every day, they used a silver shovel to scoop up coals - in order not to waste money had it been from gold. However, today he uses a golden one throughout, and a light one at that - to preserve his strength because it is a hard day for the High Priest, who is fasting like everybody. Every day a Kohen burned half of the incense in the morning and a half in the afternoon, but today the High Priest prepares two handfuls of incense to burn in the Holy of Holies.
