 Now that we know that the Temple's chametz is not "yours" and is less stringent, what if one does eat it after all? Does he have to bring a special sacrifice for using Temple's property? Some say that yes: since after Passover, it is not prohibited and can be redeemed, he has used the Temple value and has to pay. However, others say that one does not bring this sacrifice: since by eating chametz, he anyway forfeits his soul, he is spared the monetary punishment.
