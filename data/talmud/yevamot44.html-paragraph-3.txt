 If one re-marries his ex-wife, who married someone else in the interim, the child is a mamzer. That is only the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, but the Sages say that a mamzer is born only through a liaison with a married woman or a similar severe transgression. All agree, however, about another situation. If one divorced his wife and married any of her forbidden relatives, the child is indeed a mamzer. Regarding in-law relationships, a divorc√©e is like a wife.
