 However, because most of the offerings laws of sacrifices include the term "sons of Israel", the non-Jewish are excluded from some stringencies. Thus, if a Kohen, while slaughtering the sacrifice, intends that its meat will be eaten beyond the allotted time, then, even though the sacrifice becomes invalid, eating its meat does not carry the usual penalty of being cut off from the people. The same applies to the leftover meat which was left beyond its time, and to eating it in the state of ritual impurity. These are the words of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yose, however, holds a person liable to the usually penalty for all these actions.
