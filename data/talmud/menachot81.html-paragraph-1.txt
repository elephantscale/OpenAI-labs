 If one promises to bring a thanksgiving offering, he should use the animal and the breads from regular supplies. If he says, "I will bring it from the regular supplies and the breads from tithe," his first words takes effect, and he has to bring both from regular supplies. If he promises to bring both from tithe, he may do so, only he should not bring the wheat kernels of tithe, but rather use the tithe money.
