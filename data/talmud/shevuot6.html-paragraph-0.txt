Shevuot 6 - White Spots on Skin There are two shades of white color on one's skin that signify that one is possibly sick with a spiritual leprosy called Tsara'at. Two are mentioned in the Torah as "white spot" and "raised white spot." Two more are derived from the word "additional," meaning auxiliary shades of white. They thus make "two that are four."
