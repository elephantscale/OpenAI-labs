Sotah 29 - Can you ask him? Earlier, we saw a difference in the laws of purity between humans, whom you can ask about the situation, and inanimate objects that cannot be questioned. If a doubt about purity arises in a yard (or another private area), then if it is about a human, who can be queried, he is declared impure. But if it is about a piece of meat, for example, then it is declared pure. We learned this law from the purity of a suspected wife, but there is yet another source for it.
