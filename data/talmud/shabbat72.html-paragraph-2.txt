 Rav Hamnuna challenged Ulla: "Imagine that one cohabited with a woman slave, then cohabited again, then designated and brought a sacrifice to the Temple, and now he tells the Kohen to wait a little longer till he cohabits again and comes back, so that his sacrifice will atone for the newest act also, will it work? Do you mean to go that far?" To this Ulla replied, "You are talking about an act after the designations of the sacrifice? That I never have meant; after designation he will need another offering."
