Menachot 91 - Which Offerings Require Libations The Torah said, "When you shall make a fire offering to God, burned offering, or another sacrifice." I might have thought that any offering that goes on the fire requires libations, and even an offering of flour requires another flour libation with it. The prevent this, the Torah states "burned offering," to exclude a flour offering. And how do I know that a peace offering requires libations? From the words "another sacrifice."
