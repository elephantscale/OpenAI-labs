 When one who says, " (1) I did bequest you this gift, (2) but I was sick then, and now that I recovered that gift is invalid" we should follow the "mouth" rule and believe him. However Rabbi Meir considers the gift document as valid without certification. If so, we know (1) from the document itself, and do not believe the man on (2).
