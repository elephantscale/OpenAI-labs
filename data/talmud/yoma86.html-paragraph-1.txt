 It also depends on the person. For example, Rav, a prominent Torah scholar in Babilonia, said that Hillul Hashem occurs when a scholar like him does not pay the butcher's bill on time. The reason is, such behavior will lead the butcher to suspect stealing. Abbaye said, "This applies only in the city where the customers bring money to the butcher. But if the custom is for the butcher to go and collect money owed, this is not a problem."
