 Cases of lashes are decided by three judges: "...And they (the judges) shall judge them..." gives two judges as the minimal number of "they," and since a court consisting of an even number of judges is not acceptable, one more judge is added. Rabbi Ishmael requires twenty three judges, based on the use of the same word "evildoer" in "...evildoer liable to lashes..." and in "...who is an evildoer to die."
