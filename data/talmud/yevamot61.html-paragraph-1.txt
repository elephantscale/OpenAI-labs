 Another lenient law from Rabbi Shimon: an idolater's grave does not spread ritual impurity under a roof, so that a person in this situation remains pure. Why? - The Torah said, "Man (Adam), when he dies under a roof...transmits impurity." And only Jews are called "Adam," because their souls all come from reincarnations of Adam's soul - which is not true for idolaters.
