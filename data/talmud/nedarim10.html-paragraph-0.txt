Nedarim 10 - Should one ever vow? In general, one should avoid making vows simply because he may transgress them. Better do something good without a promise, or at least promise right before the deed. For this reason, a Nazir is called "a transgressor" - because he abstains from wine, which is wrong. Now, if just for not drinking wine one is called a sinner, how much more so is one who afflicts himself with unnecessary deprivations and fasts.
