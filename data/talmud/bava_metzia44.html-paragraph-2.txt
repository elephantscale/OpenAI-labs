 By Rabbinical law, when someone pays money for a movable object, he does not acquire it yet, and either party may renege. To finalize the sale, the buyer must take possession, by lifting the object or drawing it to himself. When gold is exchanged for silver, gold is considered merchandise whose transfer completes the sale.
