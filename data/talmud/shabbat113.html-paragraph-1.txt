 Folding garments improves them in some measure, therefore, one may fold his garments multiple times if he plans to use them on the same day, but not if he plans to use them after Shabbat, because then he is preparing on Shabbat for weekdays. Likewise, one may make the beds any number of times during Shabbat, but not when Shabbat will end soon.
