 Note that each of the Sages did not have any problem with the other one's question. Rav Ashi would tell you that "large date" implies as large as it can be, that is, with the seed. In turn, Rav Pappa would retort that a fresh barley seed has a different name, "shibboleth," and one with the shell is called "ushla." So the choice of the words itself in the rule already gives them the answer.
