Bava Metzia 115 - What May Not be Taken as a Security One who takes a portable mill as a security is liable for taking two utensils, for it is stated, "He shall not take a lower millstone or an upper millstone as a security..." Therefore, even if the lender was warned only once not to take the borrower's mill, he is liable to two sets of lashes.
