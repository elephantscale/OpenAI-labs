Zevachim 29 - Rava Masterfully Explains a Long Verse We have learned that when a kohen slaughters a sacrifice intending to eat it in the wrong place, it is simply invalid, but if he intends to eat it at the wrong time - it is rejected, and anyone who eats its meat deserves being cut off from the people. But why is this? Rava provides an explanation from a certain lengthy verse which starts with "If any of will be consumed on the third day...". Unlike others before him, Rava considers the verse in its entirety and derives many additional laws from it.
