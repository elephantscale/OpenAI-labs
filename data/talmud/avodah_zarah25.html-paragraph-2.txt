 Nakdimon wanted to give water to the pilgrims who came to Jerusalem and borrowed twelve wells of water from a Roman nobleman, promising an extraordinary sum of money if he did not return the water. The holidays came and went, but there was no rain, and the payment day was approaching. At the last moment Nakdimon prayed for rain and it did come, but the nobleman claimed that the rain had come after the day had ended. Nakdimon then prayed again, and the sun stood, to show that the payment day still continued.
