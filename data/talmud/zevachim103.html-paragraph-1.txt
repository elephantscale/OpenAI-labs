 Therefore, the rule is that whenever the Altar does not get the right to the meat, the kohanim do not get the right to the hide. However, if an offering was valid even for some time, so that the Altar got the right to the meat, the kohanim acquired the right to the hide. This rule is derived from a phrase "the burnt offering of a man." Since the rule would be also true for a woman, the extra word "man" teaches us that it was valid for men to eat.
