 Two potential prohibitions need to be overridden when burning sacrifices in the Temple: Shabbat and ritual impurity. Rav Huna said it is the first one overridden but not the second one, and Rabbah said it is only the second one. Abaye asked a question that is a problem equally for both: the Torah said, "Bring the sacrifice in its time," which seems to mean, "even on Shabbat and even if ritually impure." Why prefer one exemption and leave out the other?
