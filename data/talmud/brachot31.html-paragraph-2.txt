 What does "rejoice with trepidation" mean? - That one should not loose the awareness of God even in supreme joy. Abaye was sitting and learning before Rabbah, and Rabbah noticed that Abaye was excessively cheerful. He said to Abaye, "Rejoice with trepidation!?" - Abaye answered, "I am wearing tefillin." Some say that Abbaye was joyful to finally be able to fulfill this mitzvah, and others - that tefillin themselves have a spiritual effect on a person.
