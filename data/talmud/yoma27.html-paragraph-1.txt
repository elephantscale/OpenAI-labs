 By "everybody was equal," the teacher really means that even a non-Kohen was allowed to do the flaying and the cutting. But how do we know this? - Since the Torah said, "He shall have the burned offering skinned and cut into pieces. Aharon's sons shall place the fire on the Altar..." we understand that starting from the fire service, a Kohen is required, but before that - he is not.
