 For example, the well-known first rules at the beginning of the Talmud talk about reading the Shema prayer at night. There we mentioned that a bridegroom is exempt from saying Shema - because he is worried about upcoming cohabitation with his bride, being unsure if he will succeed in rupturing her hymen and complete the act of cohabitation - and this exemption lasts until the end of Shabbat. This must prove that cohabitation with his bride is permitted on Shabbat, contrary to what Shmuel has said!?
