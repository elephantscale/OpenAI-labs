Moed Katan 12 - Can one lie? Generally, a mourner is prohibited from working unless he has nothing to eat. Even then, the community should provide for him. However, if he has contracted to do work before becoming a mourner, and the work cannot be postponed (such as a harvest), he can ask others to do it for him. Moreover, in cases where he cannot ask others, he can do the work. Take, for example, a donkey driver with his animal who was hired for a month of work, and if he stops the job, he will lose the complete payment and cause a loss to his employer. Since his contract allows for no substitution, he cannot ask others to do the work, and therefore he can do it himself.
