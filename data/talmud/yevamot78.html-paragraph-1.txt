 From here, we start having divergent opinions. "Even until the tenth generation" is interpreted as "forever," but Resh Lakish says it literally means the tenth generation.

He meant that Heaven watches over him and causes him to die before he produces the third generation - so that the Jews would not unknowingly intermarry.
