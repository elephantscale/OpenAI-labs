Chullin 33 - Blood of Shechitah and Ritual Impurity To become susceptible to ritual impurity, food must first become wet, as the Torah said, "any usual food that has [once] been wet with water shall become unclean". In addition, the owner of the food must be content with it becoming wet. Thus, washing the fruit would qualify, while the fruit falling into the water would not.
