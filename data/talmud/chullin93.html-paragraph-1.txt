 Rav Abba said, "The blood vessels in the foreleg are prohibited." Rav Safra said to him, "Moses! Did the Merciful One say 'You shall not eat meat?'" Rava answered him, "Moses! Did the Merciful One say 'You may eat blood?'" Rather, if you are roasting the meat, the heat extracts the blood. However, if you are cooking the meat in a pot, you need to cut the vessels open first and salt them. Otherwise the prohibited blood gets reabsorbed into the meat.
