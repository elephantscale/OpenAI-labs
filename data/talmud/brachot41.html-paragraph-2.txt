 The seven species are mentioned in this Torah phrase, "It is a land of wheat, barley, grapes, figs and pomegranates - a land of oil-olives and honey-[dates]." Moreover, this phrase dictates the order of preference between the seven species themselves. However, Rav Chanan uses this phrase for a different conclusion, namely, that each of the fruit is used in some law in the Torah as a measurement. For example, wheat: if one goes into a house afflicted with tzaraat (spiritual leprosy), his garments become ritually impure only if he spends there "enough time to eat half a loaf of wheat bread." Barley: a human bone the size of a barley kernel imparts spiritual impurity of the dead, but not if it is less than that. Vine - a measure of it is prohibited to a nazirite. Figs - by carrying as much as a volume of a dried fig one transgresses Shabbat, and so on.
