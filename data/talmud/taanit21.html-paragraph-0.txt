Taanit 21 - That, too, is for the best Nachum ish Gam Zu was called this way because he was accustomed to saying, "That, too, (gam zu) is for the best." Once the Jews needed to send a gift of precious pearls to the Roman emperor. They chose Nachum ish Gam Zu because "he is used to miracles happen on his behalf." On the road, people at an inn exchanged the precious stones in his chest for dirt from the house. In the morning, when Nachum saw it, he said, "This, too, is for the best," and continued on his way to present it to the emperor. When the latter saw the dirt, he was enraged, "Jew are mocking me!" and decided to kill them all. Nachum said, "That, too, is for the best."
