Chullin 17 - They Should Always Do Shechitah One of the rules of kosher slaughter of animals is formulated thus: "All are slaughtered, and we always slaughter, and we slaughter with anything, except with a harvesting sickle, a saw, animal teeth or a nail, because these instruments strangle rather than cut." What do these words mean? "All are slaughtered" teaches that birds, too, require shechitah.
