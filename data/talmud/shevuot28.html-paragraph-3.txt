 Avimi asked a third question, "'An oath that I will not eat ten figs, an oath that I will not eat nine,' - and then he ate ten, what is the law?" Aifa answered, "He transgressed once, since the second oath is included in the first." "Wrong!" - said Avimi - "The first oath prohibits ten figs, but allows nine, so the second oath is stricter than the first!" - and if he eats ten figs, he transgresses two oaths.
