 Turianus accused the Jews of murdering his daughter. Two men, Lullianus and Papus, stepped up and falsely admitted the crime. Before Turianus executed them, he said, "You are from the people of Chananya, Mishael, and Azarya; let a miracle happen to you!" They answered, "They were perfectly righteous, but we are not, and Nebuchadnezzar was a proper king, but you are a commoner. However, God chose you to execute us so that He can then take revenge against you." Turianus nevertheless killed them right away, and at that very moment, messengers arrived from Rome to execute him in turn. This happened on the twelfth of Adar.
