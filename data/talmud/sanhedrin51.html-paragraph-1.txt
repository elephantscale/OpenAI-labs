 If a daughter of a Kohen who is either betrothed or fully married commits adultery, then her punishment is correspondingly greater than that of her lover, who is punished by strangulation. But what is the meaning of Rabbi Eliezer's cryptic statement? If he meant that she commits adultery with either her father or her father-in-law, then his ruling is true even for a daughter of an Yisrael, and he did not have to state it. Rather, "with her father" means "in the domain of her father", that is, betrothed, and "with her father-in-law" means "in the domain of her father-in-law", that is, fully married.
