 The bread of vision was kneaded outside the Temple - because vessels did not sanctify the flour - and baked inside the Temple before Shabbat. Rabbi Yehudah disagrees: it was kneaded and baked inside the Temple, on Shabbat, to protect the bread from staying overnight. Rabbi Shimon maintains that both ways are valid. Their proofs are not based on the story of King David and the priestly bread - for David had a case of boulimia - extreme hunger - but on tradition.
