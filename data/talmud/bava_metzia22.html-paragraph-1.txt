 The case of a robber is understandable - the owner despairs of getting his things back, and the recipient thus acquires them. But in the case of a thief the owner is not aware of his loss! It must be that the despair which will come later is already effective, just like Rava and not Abaye? No! The "thief" is an armed robber, who is like a thief in that he hides - so here too the owner despairs.
