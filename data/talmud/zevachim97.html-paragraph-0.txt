Zevachim 97 - Can Cooking on the Next Day Remove Forbidden Flavors From the Day Before? According to Rabbi Tarfon, if one cooked the meat of offerings in a vessel at the beginning of the festival, he may continue to cook in it the entire festival. The usual requirement of breaking or purging the vessels after the time allotted for the sacrifice does not apply here. However, the Sages say that once the time allotted for eating the sacrifice has passed, the vessel needs to be purged and rinsed.
