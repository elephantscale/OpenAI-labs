Yoma 71 - The last service of the day The High Priest is ready to close the Yom Kippur service. He again washes his hands and feet before removing his white linen vestments, undresses, descends, immerses, ascends, and dries himself. This is his fifth and final immersion of the day. They bring him the golden vestments, he dresses and sanctifies his hands and feet. Then he enters the Sanctuary to burn the afternoon incense and to lights the lamps of the Menorah.
