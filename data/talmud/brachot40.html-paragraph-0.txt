Brachot 40 - Serving bread In general, one should eat the bread right after he said the blessing on it. However, if he interrupts for the needs of the meal, this is considered a necessity, and later he can eat without saying the blessing again. For example, Rav, having broken off a piece, would give pieces to his guests, saying to each "Please take a piece of this bread which has been blessed." Rabbi Yochanan added that if he says, "Bring the salt, please" or "Bring the relish," this is also a necesssity, and not an interrupttion. Rav Sheshet said that even if he says, "Knead food for oxen," that, too, is not an interruption, because one is a supposed to feed his animals before he eats himself, as the Torah said in Shema, "And I will give grass for your animals... and you will eat and be satisfied."
