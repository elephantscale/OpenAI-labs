Sanhedrin 109 - Life in the Ark Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, once said to Noah's son, Shem the Great, "Life in the ark was naturally hard for the animals, but what about you, the humans?" Shem answered that they indeed endured great distress. Animals had to be fed by day or by night, depending on their habits, and Noah with his sons was always busy. There was a small bird resembling quail, called Zikita, and Noah did not know what it ate. Once he was standing eating a pomegranate, a worm fell out, and the bird ate it. After this, Noah would prepare bran until it would become wormy, then feed the worms to the bird.
