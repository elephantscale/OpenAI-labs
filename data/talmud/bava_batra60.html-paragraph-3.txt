 When the Temple was destroyed, many Jews became ascetics and resolved not to eat meat and not to drink wine. Rabbi Yehoshua asked them why. They said, because the Temple does not have it anymore. He said, then you should not eat bread, fruit, or drink water, because these too were parts of the Temple service. Rather, in a house leave a small part unpainted, and in a feast skip a dish.
