 This rule was taught by God to Moses on Sinai and has not been recorded in the Torah. But what is its logic? Is it an exception to all rules, or does it work as an inheritance? And if you say that a daughter would not share in the inheritance anyway, what if the man has only one daughter? Can she become a nazir (nazirah) and use her father's money? The rule above tells us that only a son can do so.
