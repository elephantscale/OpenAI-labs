Beitzah 17 - No food mix We learned that when a Holiday (Yom Tov) falls out on a Friday, one is allowed to cook for the needs of the Yom Tov, but not for the Shabbat right after it. However, if one leaves a little food over from Thursday (called "eruvei tavshilin), cooking for Shabbat becomes permitted.
