 If one vows to give "half of his symbolic value," he gives half, but if he vows to give "symbolic value of half of him" - then he pays the full amount, because half of him cannot live without the other half. In this respect, real value vows are the same: if he vows value of half of him, it is tantamount to the whole value.
