 If a seller stated that he was selling a field of a certain size, and he also identified the field by its landmarks and boundaries, he has made two contradictory statements. "Within these landmarks and boundaries" means selling as is, no matter what the size. The fact that he added the size of the field compels him to at least come close to this size.
