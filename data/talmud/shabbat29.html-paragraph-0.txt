Shabbat 29 - A folded garment If one took a small piece of clothing, the size of three by three finger-breadths, and folded it into a wick, but did not singe it as yet, then Rabbi Eliezer says that it is still a garment, and therefore can become ritually impure. According to Rabbi Eliezer, merely folding a garment into a wick does not change the fact that it is a garment; additional singeing would make it into a wick, and it would not accept ritual impurity any longer. Rabbi Akiva, however, says that folding a garment does make it into a complete wick, and it is not susceptible to impurity.
