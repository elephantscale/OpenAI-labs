 Should one only study Torah, or should one also work for sustenance? In the school of Rabbi Ishmael they taught that since the Torah says both "This book of Torah shall never depart from your mouth" and "you will gather in your grain," then one should do both. However, Rabbi Shimon asked, "If he sows and harvests and processes the grain, when does he study?" - rather, one should dedicate himself completely to Torah. Many followed Rabbi Ishmael and succeeded, tried to follow Rabbi Shimon, and did not succeed.
