 If a seriously ill person consecrates all his possessions to the Temple treasury and then recovers, does his bequest stand? Do we say that whenever the Temple Estate is involved, the person is likely to grant possession with complete resolve, and thus the bequest stands? Or does he value his own interests more, and the gift is revocable if he recovers?
