 There are also areas that are not completely private - because they are not surrounded by walls - nor are they public, since multitudes don't usually go there. Such areas includes a sea and an area in front of a store where merchants show their wares. Since such an area has the traits of both private and public domains, the Sages prohibited carrying in them, just like in public domain, and transfering from them to both a private and a public domain.
