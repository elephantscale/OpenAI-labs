Horayot 11 - How is Anointed High Priest Different An anointed High Priest is installed into his office by being anointed with the special oil prepared by Moses, and by donning four extra vestments in addition to the four garments of the regular priest. After the anointing oil was concealed, only the installation by donning the extra vestments remained.
