 Said Rabbah bar bar Channah: "Those that go down to the sea told me that the wave that sinks a ship appears to have a fringe of white fire at its tip. But when one strikes it with a club upon which the following names of God are engraved, I Shall Be What I Shall Be, Yah, God of Legions, Forever - it subsides."
