Sukkah 41 - Remembering the Temple and building it again The Sukkot bunch is taken and waved only on the first day of Sukkot, but it is done all seven days in the Temple. The Torah said, "on Sukkot, take the bunch and rejoice for seven days before God" - that is, do it once, but in the Temple - all seven days. After the Temple was destroyed, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai decreed to take the bunch all seven days to remember how it was done in the Temple.
