 Why is the man believed about himself? - Because anybody can create a prohibition with his own words in the situation where he stands to lose. But why is he not believed in his children? After all, a father is believed to tell us which of these sons is the firstborn!? Once we believe him that he is an idolater, he is no longer qualified to testify on Jewish matters. Others say that the man believes even about his children, precisely because we would believe him about the firstborn, but he is not believed about his grandchildren.
