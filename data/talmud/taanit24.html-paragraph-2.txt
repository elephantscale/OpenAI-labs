 Rava decreed a fast, but the rain did not come. They told him, "When Rav Yehudah fasted, rain would always come." Rava agreed. He said, "When he took off one shoe, it already rained." What is this story? Rav Yehudah once saw people throwing bread. He said, "Better there should be a famine," and so it was. The Sages asked his assistant, Rav Kahana, to take him into the market. Rav Yehudah saw a long line and asked, "What is this?" Rav Kahana told him, "People line up for flour from date pits." Rav Yehudah said, "It must be that a famine came; we need to proclaim a fast." On strict fasts, wearing leather shoes is prohibited, and Rav Yehudah asked his assistant to remove his shoes. As soon as the first one was off, the rain came. Elijah, the prophet, rushed to say, "Do not take off another shoe, or else God will destroy the world." But often, owing to the extreme shame and humiliation of the Sages who could not bring the rain, the rain would indeed come.
