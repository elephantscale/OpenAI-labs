 But how can all water come from Euphrates seeing that there are springs in the high mountains? - They are fed by underground channels. And why is it called Euphrates? Because its waters multiply ("parim" in Hebrew). This teaching supports Shmuel, who said that a river is primarily fed from its bedrock, and disagrees with the father of Shmuel, who would build a separate mikvah for his daughter in Euphrates, because he felt that its water comes at times mostly from rain.
