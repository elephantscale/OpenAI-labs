 Before the calendar was fixed, Yom Kippur could fall on Friday. In this case Rabbi Ishmael permits to fold garments on Yom Kippur in preparation for Shabbat. If Yom Kippur falls on Sunday, one can burn Shabbat offerings in the Temple on the Yom Kippur day, because Yom Kippur has lesser sanctity than Shabbat. However, Rabbi Akiva considers the two days to be of equal strenght, and fordibs preparing on one for the other. Both base their proof on the phrase from the Torah, "Bring Shabbat offering on its own Shabbat," but understand it differently.
