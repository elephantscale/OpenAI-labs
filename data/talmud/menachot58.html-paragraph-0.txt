Menachot 58 - No Leaven and No Honey The Torah emphasized that "Any leaven or any honey (meaning fruit or fruit juice) will be brought on the Altar" to teach that not only a volume of an olive, but also half-an-olive or less is also forbidden. It had to repeat the word "any." Ordinarily, we can learn such lessons from one instance of the word "any" and apply it to other similar situations. Here, however, leaven and honey each have additional stringencies not found in the laws of the other, so the word "any" had to be repeated.
