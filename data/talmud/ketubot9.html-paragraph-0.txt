Ketubot 9 - Claims of "not a virgin" If the husband claims "I found an open opening" - that is, he felt that his wife was not a virgin, then he may not be believed as far as the girl is concerned, but he is believed to impose a restriction on himself, and he now cannot live with her. This is the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. Others say he would not be believed even for himself since his feelings are subjective.
