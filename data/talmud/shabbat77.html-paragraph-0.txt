Shabbat 77 - Rav Yehudah in a jovial mood Continuing with the amounts of matter carrying which violates Shabbat, wine is significant if one can make a cup used for a blessing after a meal. Since we are talking here about pure wine, which in the times of this ruling was first diluted, we arrive at a measure called "reviit," or about 75 grams. Honey is considered significant if there is enough of it to be put on a sore. Rav Ashi asked, "At the top of the sore, or from the top down?" - No answer was found.
