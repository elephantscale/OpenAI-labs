 Haman went to Mordechai to put him on the king's horse. However, Mordechai said he was weak from the fast and could not mount the horse by himself. Haman had to bow down and allow Mordechai to step on him. As he was climbing the horse, Mordechai also kicked Haman. Haman asked him, "How can you do this? Your own king Solomon tells you, 'When your enemy falls, do not rejoice.'?" Mordechai answered, "That is said about a Jewish enemy. But about you, it says, 'You shall tread upon their high places.'"
