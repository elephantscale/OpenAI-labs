 A man from the valley of Beit Chortan took this idea to the extreme. He surrounded his field with the shapes of a door on all four sides as follows: he thrust four poles at the four corners on his field and stretched a vine across. His question now was, is that a valid separation? The matter came before the Sages, and they said that this indeed was a separation for planting. Normally, one should not plant wheat next to a vineyard. However, with the shape of a door serving as separation, it was allowed. Although the roots of the plants were next two each other and mixing, the shape of a door legally separated them into two distinct domains, and planting of wheat next the vineyard was allowed.
