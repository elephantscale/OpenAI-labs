 Rav said, "The case is where he consecrated the birds, but they flew away, and he found them," and Shmuel said "He consecrated his hen as money for the Temple, and it flew away and nested elsewhere." It is understandable why Shmuel does not agree to Rav, because Shmuel's explanation is wider in scope, but why does Rav not agree to Shmuel? Rav will say that when a hen flies away, its monetary sanctity disappears. And Shmuel? He will answer that the hen is still consecrated in the wild, because "To God belong the earth and its fullness."
