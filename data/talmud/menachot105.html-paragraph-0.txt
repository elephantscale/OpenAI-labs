Menachot 105 - One Who Promises a Flour Offering The Torah said "When a soul (person) offers a flour offering to God..." Why "soul?" God said, "Who usually brings flour? A poor man. I consider it as if he offered his soul." Why are there five different ways to cook the flour offering? This is similar to a king whom his poor friend invited for a meal, and the king said, "Make many types of flour dishes, and I will enjoy them."
