 However, if he then remembered that it was Shabbat, but this time forgot that reaping and grinding were prohibited, he would be liable to two sacrifices, one for each error. Finally, if he becomes aware of his first mistake, then his initial reaping connects to the second one, his initial grinding connects to the second one, and the end result is that he brings only one sacrifice for all, and it drags along the atonement for his other acts. The other way around is not completely true: if he finds out about his later reaping, it connects to the previous one, but his later grinding does not connect to the first one, and he needs a separate sacrifice for that. We don't use the principle of drag-along twice - this is the opinion of Rava.
