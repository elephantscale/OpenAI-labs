 If people are not charitable, if they withhold what is due the kohen's and the poor, skies are withheld from giving due and rain, prices increase, and men run after their livelihood but fail to achieve it. Conversely, a charitable nation is blessed with wealth. The source for this is in Job: "The dry and the warm season steal the waters of the dry season." What is the connection? - Because of things that are done in warm season, that is, separation of the kohen's and poor people's portions from the crop - if it is not done - the waters of snow will be stolen from you in winter, the time of beneficial rains in Israel. For charitable behavior, one is promised a blessing "without limit," literally, "without enough", which mean that his lips will tire of saying "enough."
