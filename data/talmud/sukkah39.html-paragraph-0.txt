Sukkah 39 - Sukkot on the seventh year When one buys a Sukkot bunch from his fellow on the seventh year (Sabbatical, or Shmita), then - since the etrog that he is buying is a fruit, and fruit should be treated with special care on the Shmita year - he should only pay for the lulav, the palm branch, and ask for the etrog to be given to him as a present. Why? - his fellow may not be all that knowledgeable in the laws of Shmita. He may not know how to deal with the money from this sale.
