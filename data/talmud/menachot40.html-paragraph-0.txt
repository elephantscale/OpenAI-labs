Menachot 40 - Beit Shammai Do Not Allow Shaatnez Anywhere We learned earlier that the forbidden mixture of wool and linen, or shaatnez, is allowed in tzitzit, because the two commandments follow each other in the Torah, forming a "this is prohibited, [but] this is allowed" pattern. However, this is only the opinion of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai, who do not derive conclusions from the proximity of phrases, consequently do not allow Shaatnez in the tzitzit.
