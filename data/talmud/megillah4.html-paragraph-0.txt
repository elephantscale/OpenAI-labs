Megillah 4 - Why is the Megillah never read on Shabbat Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, "Women, too, are included in the mitzvah of listening to the Megillah." Why? - Because they were included in the miracle of Purim. Some say, it means that they were in danger, and some - that the salvation came through them.
