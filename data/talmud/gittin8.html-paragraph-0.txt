Gittin 8 - What is the difference between a ship and a flower pot? We saw that a messenger bringing a divorce document (Get) from outside of Israel must confirm that he saw it being written and signed. The Talmud also discusses which neighboring cities and areas are still considered the Land of Israel of this purpose and which are not. Would writing a Get on a ship close to Israel be considered the same as on land?
