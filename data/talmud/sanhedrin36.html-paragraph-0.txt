Sanhedrin 36 - Description of the Sanhedrin Trying a Capital Case A sanhedrin was seated in the shape of half a circular "threshing floor," that is, in a semicircle, so that the judges could see each other. Two judicial scribes stand before them, one to the right and one to the left, and they would record the words of those arguing for conviction and the words of those arguing for acquittal. Both scribes record all words, so that if one errs, he can be corrected from the other scribe's notes.
