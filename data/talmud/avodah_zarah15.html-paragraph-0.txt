Avodah Zarah 15 - Animal Laws In a place where the people follow the custom to sell small livestock to idol worshippers, one is allowed to do so, and in a place where the custom is not to sell small livestock, one is not allowed to do so. The reason for this rule is that in the first place, idolaters are careful to guard against bestiality, but in the second they are accustomed to permit it.
