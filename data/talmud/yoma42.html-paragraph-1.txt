 On the subject of the red heifer, the Torah said that "it will be slaughtered in front of Elazar, the priest." From here, we see that one who slaughters it does not have to be a priest (Kohen). Others say that since it is a Temple service, the one who slaughters had to be a priest also. Regardless, the High Priests made a point of always slaughtering the red heifer themselves and otherwise showing their appreciation for this mitzvah.
