Yevamot 24 - He does not know whom he married If a man betrothed one of two sisters but does not know which of them he betrothed - he needs to give a divorce (Get) to each one. He cannot live with any one of them - because perhaps he betrothed the other one, and this one is prohibited to him as his wife's sister.
