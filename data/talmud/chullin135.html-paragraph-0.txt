Chullin 135 - The First of the Fleece Another gift given to a kohen is the first of the fleece. Since the Torah said, "And the first of the fleece of your flock you shall give to him (the kohen)," whenever one shears his sheep, he must give part of the fleece to a kohen. This mitzvah is not connected to land, and thus applies both inside of Israel and outside. It also applies whether the Temple is standing or not. However, since the Torah said "your flock", we understand that the flock of the Temple is not included, and thus one does not give to a kohen fleece from sacrifices.
