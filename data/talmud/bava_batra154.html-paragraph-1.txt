 The rule "The mouth that forbids it is the mouth that allows it" can be illustrated as follows. In a case where a woman who told the court that she was married, but added that she divorced or that her husband died, her first statement makes it forbidden to her to marry other men, but the second one makes it allowed. If we believe the first statement, we should also believe the second one.
