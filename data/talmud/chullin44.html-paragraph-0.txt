Chullin 44 - The Pharynx The stiff, uppermost section of the food-pipe, roughly equivalent to the pharynx, is where the food-pipe is attached to the jaw. Rav says that any slight puncture in it renders the animal a terefah. Why? According to Rav, there is no limit where one can cut the food-pipe, and it is only the windpipe that has limits. It follows then that the pharynx is a place of shechitah, and no puncture there is tolerated. On the contrary, Shmuel says that there is a definite limit where the food-pipe can be cut, and it is below the pharynx. Accordingly, the pharynx itself can be punctured, as long as the defect is less than its half.
