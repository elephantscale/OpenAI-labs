 For each step, one needed to have the proper intention. If he is bringing a Passover offering, he should have in mind that he is slaughtering the animal as a Passover offering, receiving the blood for a Passover offering, and so on.

This means that to have the Seder tonight, he will need to bring another animal sacrifice.
