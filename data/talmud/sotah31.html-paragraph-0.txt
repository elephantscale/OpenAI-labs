Sotah 31 - Parrot A husband who jealously warns his wife not to seclude herself with a particular man is putting himself into several complications. If he hears that she did seclude herself with the man, even as told to him by a parrot, he then needs to divorce her. This is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who says that we would even believe the husband himself, so once the husband is sure about the seclusion, his warning is triggered. However, he has to pay her the money of the Ketubah since he does not have any proof, and it was his fault that he got into this situation.
