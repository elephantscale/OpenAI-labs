 If an idol is known to have been broken on its own - for example, if it fell from a roof - then Rabbi Yochanan said that it is prohibited for benefit, but Resh Lakish said that it is permitted. According to Rabbi Yochanan, fragments are forbidden because no idol worshipper nullified them. But according to Resh Lakish, he did nullify it, reasoning that if the idol cannot protect itself, surely it cannot protect anybody else.
