What about keeping on the same level? For example, can one sell a synagogue to buy another one? The rule leaves it open, and there are two opinions ("yes" and "no"), but in practice, it is permitted. There are also other considerations with the synagogue: care must be taken to prevent negligence of not buying or building another synagogue later.
