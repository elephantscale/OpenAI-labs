Brachot 44 - The fruit of Kinneret If they brought him a salted food, and with it - bread, then he says the blessing on the salted food, and bread is included. That is the rule: any time you have a primary food and another one accompanying it, you say the blessing on the primary food, and it suffices for the accompanying one.
