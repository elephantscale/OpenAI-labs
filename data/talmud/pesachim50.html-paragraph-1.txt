 Similarly, on the Shmita year, one has to remove from his possession the fruit he has collected, once they are finished in the fields, and leave it for everyone to use. If he comes to a place where they are already putting the fruit into the streets for everyone's enjoyment, he too has to do it, even if in his home town the time to remove the fruit has not come yet and vice versa.
