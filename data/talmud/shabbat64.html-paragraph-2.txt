 A frontlet or head bangles can be worn when sewn into a woman's hat - because she would not take the hat off in the street and uncover her hair. A woman may go out with a wad in her sandal, for comfort, or with a peppercorn in her mouth, for pleasant breath - provided that she puts these in before Shabbat, for otherwise the onlookers may think that it is just a design to carry in a public area.
