 First question: the incense between the fingers and hands of the High Priest on Yom Kippur - should it be burned on the coals or no? In the phrase, "and he will scoop with full hands, and he will bring..." which word is more important? If it is "he will scoop with full hands," then even the particles in between are included, but if it is "and he will bring," - then it is not his intention to bring them, and so they are not included.
