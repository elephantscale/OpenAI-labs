Chullin 132 - Gifts for the Daughter of a Kohen Ulla used to give kohen's gifts to a kohenet - a daughter of a kohen. Why? When the Torah told to give the gifts to a kohen, we understand that a kohenet is excluded. However, when it said the word "kohen" again, this is a double exclusion, which always means an inclusion, and a kohenet is now included. Rav Pappa was married to a kohenet, and people would bring him kohen's gifts.
