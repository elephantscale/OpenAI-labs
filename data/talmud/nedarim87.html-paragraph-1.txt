 We thus see that confirming the vow and annulling it are different. There is another way to look at it. Since the Torah said that "The husband will confirm and the husband will annul," we compare the two: just as in confirming it, once he confirms part, the whole is confirmed, and so is annulment: once he annuls part, the total is annulled. This is indeed the view of Rabbi Akiva.
