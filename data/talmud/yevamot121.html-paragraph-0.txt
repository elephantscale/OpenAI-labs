Yevamot 121 - A man fell into water If one fell into a water reservoir, whether a small one, such that all of it can be observed, or one larger than that - he might still be saved, and his wife cannot re-marry based on this testimony alone. Rabbi Meir quotes an incident to support this ruling: a man fell into a large water cistern and emerged after three days. This proves that even in such situations, there is a possibility that the construction of a cistern or a pond will allow him to survive. Certainly, in a large body of water, he could have been saved by waves, for example, and emerged far away, out of the sight of observers.
