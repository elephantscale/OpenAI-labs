Eruvin 15 - Abaye wins If a side-post was not erected specifically for observing Shabbat laws, but just happened to be there, will it work to permit carrying in the valley? Abaye says that it will - if they relied on it at the beginning of Sabbath - after all, they relied on it! However, Rava says that it does not help, since it was not made expressly for this purpose from the beginning. The Talmud lists a number of possible arguments pro and con, but Rava and Abaye remain unconvinced. The law, however, uncharacteristically follows Abaye - the side-post helps - and this is the "L" in the six cases abbreviated Y A L K G M where the law follows Abaye against Rava.
