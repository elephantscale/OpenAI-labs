 Rav Adda bar Matnah asked, "Granted that one may insulate his food with flocking, but can he then move that flocking? Is it not set aside, and not fit for Shabbat use?" Abaye answered with a question, "Just because he does not have a box of straw and uses expensive material, does he renounce his use if it for later? - Of course not, he will do something with it later, and therefore he should not move it on Shabbat!" The Talmud answers, "It could be that this logic only applies if he did not use flocking for insulation, and he is not going to lie down on it, so indeed it has no use on Shabbat, but if he used it as insulation, that's exactly its use!" The question thus remains not completely resolved.
