Nedarim 56 - A bed for good fortune If one vows not to enter a house, he can still use the attic - so says Rabbi Meir because people think of the attic as something separate from the house. But the Sages disagree since they estimate that people mean the complete house, including the attic. However, if he specifically said that he won't enter the attic, all agree that he meant that, and he can still enter the house.
