 Even though we saw Rava earlier postulate that one can simply play music on a shofar and fulfill his Rosh Hashanah shofar obligation without meaning to do so, in truth, the intention is paramount. Here is an example. "When Moses would raise his hand, Israel would prevail over Amalek, but when he lowered his hand, Amalek was stronger." But do Moses' hands make or break the battle? Instead, when Israel "gazed upward," concentrating on the purpose of the fight, they would win. Thus, Moses's hands were only a signal to Israel. Others explain that the concentration of Israel was giving Moses the strength to pray. Another example: "Make a fiery serpent and place it on a pole, so that anyone bitten by a snake would look at the serpent and live." Instead, when Israel "gazed upwards," they were healed.
