Menachot 38 - The Blue Thread in Tzitzit "Blue" in the tzitzit, or "Tchelet", is wool that has been dyed with blue dye produced from "blood" (that is, inky secretion) of a rare Mediterranean sea creature known as chilazon. For many centuries, this dye was unavailable because the identity of the chilazon was forgotten. However, if the tzitzit (ritual fringes) is made completely of white strings, it is still valid.
