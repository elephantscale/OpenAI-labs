Eruvin 12 - Crossbar and - or a post? In order to carry in his alleyway on Shabbat, one needs to adjust it by putting up a crossbeam on top or a post on the side, as we have seen multiple times before. This, however, is the opinion of Beit Hillel. By contrast, Beit Shammai require more: both a crossbeam and a side-post.
