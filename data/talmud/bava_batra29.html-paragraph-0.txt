Bava Batra 29 - The Length of Residence for Presumptive Ownership Presumptive ownership of houses, ditches, and bathhouses - or any other property that yields benefits continually - is established after three years of uncontested occupancy from day to day. For other properties it depends on their normal use, for example, a presumptive ownership for a field is established after harvesting three crops.
