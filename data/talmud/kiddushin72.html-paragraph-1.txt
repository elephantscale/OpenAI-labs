 When R' Akiva died, Rebbi was born. When Rabbi died, Rav Yehudah was born. When Rav Yehudah died, Rava was born. When Rava died, Rav Ashi was born. This comes to teach you that a righteous person does not depart from the world until another righteous person like him is born, as it is said, "And the sun rises and the sun sets..."
