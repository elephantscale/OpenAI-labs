 Asked Rav Pappa, what if he forgot about the laws of impurity? - But what exactly did he forget? If he forgot if it is a lizard or a frog that makes him impure - let him go and learn it with the children in school! Rather, what if he forgot the amount of lizard's meat that makes him impure on contact, is it like a lentil or more, what is the law? - This question remains unresolved.
