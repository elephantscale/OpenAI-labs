 Rabbi Yitchak ben Chananiya also said that a waiter serving food must be allowed to try some of it, which refers to meat that gives off a pleasing odor and to pungent wine - or else the waiter will suffer from craving. Others say that this refers to all savory foods. There was a righteous man who would give the waiter from every course - and Elijah the Project would speak to him, while another righteous man only gave from one, and from the rest- after the meal, and with him, Elijah would not talk.
