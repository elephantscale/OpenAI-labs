 Someone wrote a gift document but did not record the fact that he was a seriously ill person, nor that he was healthy, and then a dispute arouse about the validity of the gift. The donor says "I was sick when I wrote the document and I have since recovered, hence my recovery nullifies the gift," but the recipients say, "You were healthy, and the gift is therefore valid."
