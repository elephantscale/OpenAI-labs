Pesachim 112 - Spells against demons One should not drink water in the dark from ponds at night because the demon by the name of Shavrirei may be found in this water. What if one is thirsty? - If he has someone with him, he should say to his friend, "I, the son of so-and-so, am thirsty." If he has no one with him, he should say, "I, am the son of so-and-so (talking about himself), and my mother said to me, 'Beware of shavrirei, shavrirei, vrirei, rirei, irei, rei,' and I am thirsty for water in new earthenware cups."
