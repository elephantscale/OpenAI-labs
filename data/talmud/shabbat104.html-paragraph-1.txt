 When is one not liable for writing on Shabbat? - When his writing will not endure. For example, if he wrote with fruit juice, which will dry out, or he wrote in the mud or on dust. He is also not liable if he wrote in an unusual way: by turning his hand backward, by holding the pen with his mouth or with his elbow - because people don't normally write this way.
