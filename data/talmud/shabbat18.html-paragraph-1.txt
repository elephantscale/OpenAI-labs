 Incidentally, when one makes dough by pouring water onto flour, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that this is already considered kneading, while Rabbi Yose opines that "kneading" is only when one kneads the dough manually. Could it be that the rule above belongs to Rabbi Yehudah alone? - No, Rabbi Yose could agree about ink, because it is normal to knead dough, but not ink.
