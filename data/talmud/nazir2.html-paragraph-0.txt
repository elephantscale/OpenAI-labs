Nazir 2 - What is a nazir? A nazir is a person who makes a vow which includes abstaining from wine, cutting his hair, or coming into contact with a human course. It is wrong to become a nazir as self-punishment. Instead, if one chooses to become a nazir, it should be for self-improvement, and such a one is called "Holy to God."
