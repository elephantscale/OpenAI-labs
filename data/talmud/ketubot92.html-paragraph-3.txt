 Rami bar Chama wanted to say that this is precisely our previous rule: there, the orphans could not artificially inflate the worth of their mother's Ketubah, so here too, the argument of considering the $500 house worth $1,000 does not stand. Without this, the second part of the proposal does not stand either, and the creditor can collect the second house. However, Rava reversed him: in the case of orphans, their suggestion would hurt the other group of children, but in our case, the creditor would always get his $1,000 loan back.
