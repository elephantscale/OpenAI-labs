Sotah 4 - How long do they need? We learned that if a man gets especially jealous of his wife in relation to a particular fellow, he can warn her not to hide with that fellow. The warning is really for both, and later consequences may befall both. Now if they do hide, suspicion has grounds, and the husband is not allowed to continue living with his life normally any longer but needs to clear her of the suspicions in the Temple.
