 Rabbi Yehudah the Prince recommended Levi for a Rabbinical post in a particular village. When Levy arrived, they put him on a platform and asked him the following questions. Can a woman with amputated hands do a chalitzah? If she spits blood instead of saliva, what is the law? Levy did not know. They asked him a non-legal question: when an angel tells Daniel, "I will tell you what is inscribed in truthful wording," can there be untruthful wording in Heaven?
