 From the rule above, we see that thirty days in a year a considered an entire year. However, this is only the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. By contrast, Rabbi Meir says that even one day in a year is already considered an entire year. If so, how does Rabbi Meir explains the rule of thirty days for orlah cited above? He says that the tree indeed needs thirty days to take root, but if not for that, even one day in a year would make it a year old.
