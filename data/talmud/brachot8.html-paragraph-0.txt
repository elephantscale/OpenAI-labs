Brachot 8 - The Synagogue Rav Itzchak said to Rav Nachman, "Why does the master (Rav Nachman) not come to the synagogue to pray?" Rav Nachman answered, "I feel weak." - "Then assemble ten people to pray with you!" - "I don't want to trouble them." - "Then ask a messenger to come and inform you when they pray." Finally, Rav Nachman asked, "What is the significance of all these questions?" Rav Itzchak answered, "Because it is a favorable time," as in "but for me, my prayer to God is at the favorable time," and what is this - when the congregation prays. Anyone who has a synagogues in his city and does not go there to pray is called an evil neighbor.
