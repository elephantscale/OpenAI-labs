Pesachim 6 - Someone else's chametz There is an interesting contradiction in the Torah. On the one hand, it said, "No leaven shall be seen with you in your territory." So I might think that if I hide it, then it is allowed. I might also think that with me it cannot be seen, but if it belongs to someone else, such as a barrel of whiskey that someone left as a deposit, then it would be allowed.
