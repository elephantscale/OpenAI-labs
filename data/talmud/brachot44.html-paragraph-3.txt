 When does one say a complete prayer after a meal? Rabban Gamliel says that if he eats grapes or figs, or any of the seven special species, the phrase "and you will eat and be satisfied and bless God" applies to him. Rabbi Akiva says that even if he ate only vegetables, and it was his complete meal - he says the complete prayer. The Sages, however, say that he says a complete after-meal prayer only after bread, since the other seven species are too far from "and you will bless," and vegetables are not even mentioned there.
