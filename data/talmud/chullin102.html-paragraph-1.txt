 Both opinions are derived from the same source. The Torah said, "Only be strong not to eat blood, for the blood is the life, you shall not eat the life with the flesh." Just as blood is forbidden in kosher and non-kosher animals, so is the limb torn from a live animal - so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar. And the Sages? They say that "You shall not eat the life with the flesh" indeed prohibits a limb, but it should be such an animal that "flesh without life" should be permitted - that is, a kosher animal, whose meat may be eaten.
