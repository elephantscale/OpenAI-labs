 However, it is not enough to go to the mikvah, but one also needs to keep in mind why he is going there and keep this in mind consistently. For example, some people would eat their regular food only in a state of purity. And yet, when such a person goes into a mikvah, it is only suitable for everyday foods. He would not be allowed to eat the second tithe. Even though it is the same mikvah and the same person, it is not the same level of attention. Thus, while being "pure for regular food," he may have missed some subtle source of impurity which would prohibit him from eating the second tithe - just because he was not watching for it. There are five such levels: regular foods, second tithe, priestly portion, sacrificial foods, and finally, the ashes of the red heifer.
