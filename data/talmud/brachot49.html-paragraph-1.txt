 After the destruction of the Second Temple, the Sages in Yavneh composed the fourth and final part, "Who is good and Who gives good," after the siege of Bethar. The "Who is good" refers to the fact that although the bodies of the people slain at Bethar were not allowed to be buried for seven years, they did not decay, and the "Who gives good" refers to the fact that finally they were allowed to be buried.
