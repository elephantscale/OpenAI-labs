Avodah Zarah 65 - When Libation Wine Spills If libation wine fell onto grapes, one can rinse them off with water, and they are permissible; however, if the grapes were cracked, they are forbidden - because the wine which falls on the grapes will seep through the cracks into the grapes themselves, and cannot be removed by rinsing.
