 The flour sacrifice has a two-part "permitter": the handful taken from it, and the frankincense. Both need to be burned on the Altar. If one intended to consume the flour at the wrong time when he was burning one of the permitters - either the handful or the frankincense - the whole offering becomes rejected, and one who eats it deserves to be cut off from the people. This is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, and it can be summarized as "there is rejection with half of the permitter." But the Sages disagree and say that it is not rejected unless he had the wrong intent for both.
