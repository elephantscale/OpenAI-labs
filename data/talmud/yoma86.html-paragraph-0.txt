Yoma 86 - Desecration of God's name Desecration of God's name, or "Chillul Hashem," occurs when people say, "Look at what so-and-so did," and it reflects badly on God. For example, this is common when an observant Jew does something wrong. There are various means of atonement for it, such as Yom Kippur, suffering, death, or better, the study of the Torah and teaching it to others.
