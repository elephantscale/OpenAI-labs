Shabbat 46 - Finer distinctions in muktzeh Rav Yosef (who lived in Babylon) wanted to know the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan (who lived in Israel) on muktzeh - objects set aside and not used on Shabbat. When Rav Yitzhak arrived from Israel, he said, "Rabbi Yochanan agrees with the stricter, more inclusive prohibitions of Rabbi Yehudah on muktzeh." At this, Rav Yosef exclaimed, "Now I understand the previous report!" For Rabbi Yochanan had said, "They (my colleagues) hold that the law agrees with the less strict opinion of Rabbi Shimon." Now Rav Yosef understood that it meant, "They hold so, but I (Rabbi Yochanan) don't agree to it!"
