 On the other hand, maybe applying the rule of similarity is an overkill? Perhaps a simple rule of "context" would work? "Context" means if we find a law in one case, it applies to all other similar areas. For example, the father can annul a vow of his daughter. Therefore, he should be able to annul other similar vows, such as if she wants to be a Nazir (technically, "Nazirah"). - No, that logic would not work: vows are stricter in that they have no limit, but a usual Nazir is for thirty days. So maybe that's why the father needs the power to annul a vow but not a Nazir vow. Thus, we are back to using the rule of similarity.
