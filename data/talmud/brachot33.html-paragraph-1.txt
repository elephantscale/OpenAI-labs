 It once happened that a pious man was praying while on the road, and a Roman general greeted him, but he did not return the greeting. The general waited until he finished his prayer, and then asked, "It says in your Torah, 'watch yourself' and 'watch your souls greatly' By not answering you violated your own Torah and put yourself in danger. I could have cut your head off with my sword!" The pious man explained, "If you were standing in front of a king and someone greeted you, would you answer?" The general said, "No!" The pious man concluded, "How much more so for me, who was standing in front of the King of Kings!"
