 But now that the Torah has said, "outside the camp," you might think this to mean outside of all three special camps, that is, outside the Temple, outside the Temple Mount, and even outside Jerusalem - that only then one would be liable. For that, the Torah said, "in the camp." Thus, if he slaughters a sacrifices in the south, even if it is not its place, it is not called "outside," because some other sacrifices can be brought there. However, if he slaughters it outside the Courtyard, then he is liable for "slaughter outside."
