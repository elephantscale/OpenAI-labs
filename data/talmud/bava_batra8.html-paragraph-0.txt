Bava Batra 8 - Feeding the Unlearned Rabbi Yehudah the Prince opened his storehouses of food to feed the poor during the years of famine. However, he said that only the students of the Torah may enter and take food, but not unlearned folk, since he held that misfortunes come to the world only because of unlearned people.
