Menachot 79 - Wrong Intent for Bread If one slaughtered a thanksgiving offering with the wrong intent, planning to eat it beyond its time or outside its place, then the forty breads that go with it are nevertheless sanctified; however, right after becoming sanctified, they become disqualified with the same disqualification as the sacrifice itself, and thus have to be burned.
