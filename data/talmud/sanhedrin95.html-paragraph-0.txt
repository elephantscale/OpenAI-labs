Sanhedrin 95 - David, Yishbi, and Avishai God told David, "Because of you the inhabitants of Nov were killed, Doeg lost his share in the World to Come, and Shaul with his three sons died. Do you choose for your descendants to be obliterated or for yourself to be delivered in the enemy's hand?" David chose the second, and Satan, disguised as a deer, drew the hunting David into the land of the Philistines, where Yishbi, the brother of Goliath, captured him.
