 There is a situation where one can plow a single furrow and transgress eight times because of that. How so? - Firstly, he plows with an ox and a donkey tied together. Then, those animals are consecrated as sacrifices. Furthermore, he is sowing wheat in a vineyard. Besides, it is the seventh year (Shmita) when plowing is forbidden; moreover, he is doing this during a Holiday. He is a Kohen and a Nazirite, and he is plowing in a cemetery, which neither a Kohen nor a Nazirite can visit. That's eight. However, if the principle of "since" is true, then it should be only seven transgressions, and he should not be liable for plowing itself because, with the act of plowing, he produces dust, which can be used to cover the blood of a bird, a requirement of kosher slaughter. And "since" he can use the dust for this, it should not be counted!
