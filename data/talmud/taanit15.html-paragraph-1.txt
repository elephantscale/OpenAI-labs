 Similarly, one should not put on sackcloth, like King Ahab did. In his case, he was answered. Here is the story: a woman was crying, asking for help from the King. He asked her what the matter was. She told him that she agreed with her friend to boil and eat her son, and then the friend's son the next day, but now the friend hid her son. When the King heard that, he was so overwhelmed with the realization of how bad the famine was that he put on sackcloth and started to pray and, even though he was not righteous, his prayer was answered in one day - flour became plentiful and cheap.
