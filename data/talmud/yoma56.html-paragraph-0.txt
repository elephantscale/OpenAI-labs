Yoma 56 - Reminder notes Earlier the teacher told us that the High Priest "takes the blood of the goat, puts down the blood of the bull." This is because there was only one golden stand there. Otherwise, he would put the bull's blood on one golden stand first and then use the second one for the blood of the goat - and this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. The Sages say that there were two golden stands.
