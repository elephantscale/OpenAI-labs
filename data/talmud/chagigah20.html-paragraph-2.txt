 Examples of these rulings: two women accidentally exchanged their clothing, and even though they each watched them keep them in the state of purity, still Rabbi Akiva declared both sets of clothing impure. Why? As soon as the first woman realized that her dress was on her friend, of whom she was not sure if she knew all the laws - she lost concentration on her clothing, and this moment was enough to distract her, and any time one does not watch explicitly the purity, it is lost.
