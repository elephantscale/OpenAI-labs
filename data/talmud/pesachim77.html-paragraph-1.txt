 The question is more general: can the community, being impure with corpse impurity, bring communal sacrifices? This depends on the power of the tzitz, a golden plate worn by the High Priest. Since the High Priest wears the tzitz, the sacrifices are valid - this is Rabbi Yehudah's opinion. Rabbi Shimon disagrees: even if the High Priest does not wear the tzitz, it still creates acceptance.
