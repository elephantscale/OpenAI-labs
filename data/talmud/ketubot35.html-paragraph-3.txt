 Both use the case of "two men fighting and accidentally hitting a pregnant woman, with no fatality" as their source. "No fatality" leads to him paying, but we understand that if there is a fatality, he does not pay, even though he was not warned. What fatality do we mean? - The death of the woman, of course - says Resh Lakish. However, Rabbi Yochanan says that the fatality refers to the man and means that he is sentenced to death. It comes out that if he is not sentenced to death, then he pays, even though there was no warning.
