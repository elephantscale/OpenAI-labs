 What is the reason of Rabbi Yehudah? Actually, they argue in a narrow case. If the expelled mass was one of the four colors discussed previously, all agree that she is impure. They only argue about the case where she misplaced the mass before it could be examined. Rabbi Yehudah says that since statistically the miscarriage has one of these colors in the majority of cases, we have to assume that hers was the same way. However, the Sages disagree about this statistics and say that it is not a proven fact.
