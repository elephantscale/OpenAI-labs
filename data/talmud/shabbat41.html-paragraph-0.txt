Shabbat 41 - Shabbat swim Rav Zeira said, "I have observed Rabbi Abahu in a pool, but I still don't know if he swam or not." What was Rav Zeira's problem? The Sages forbade swimming in lakes and rivers on Shabbat, lest one come to make a flotation device, and this refers even to pools!? Rav Zeira did not know if this refers to pools without embankments, which are more similar to lakes, or even to pools with embankments. The Talmud discusses two more instances of Rav Abbahu's behavior about which Rav Zeira was not sure.
