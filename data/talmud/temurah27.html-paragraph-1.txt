 However the words "in place" may mean different things, depending upon context. For example, in the phrase "and if the white leprosy discoloration remains in its place," it means "occupies the place," similar to the sacrifice exchange, where one animal becomes a sacrifice instead of another one. On the other hand, when Isaiah says that "God promises to bring gold to replace copper stolen from His people," this implies redemption, where the value of one object is replaced with the value of the other. In the world of sacrifices, this would be permitted redemption.
