Yevamot 120 - When to testify about the husband's death If witnesses saw a man die, and they knew and recognized him, they can testify that he died for the benefit of his wife, to permit her to re-marry. They must, however, be confident that it is indeed the right man. Therefore, they only do it if they see the dead man's head with the nose, although the eyes and the mouth need not be intact. They cannot make an identification based on the man's body or his garments.
