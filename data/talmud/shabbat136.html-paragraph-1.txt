 Rav Adda bar Ahavah said that the answer is clear, whichever way you look at it: if it is a viable child, the Torah told to circumcise it, and if it is not, then he is simply cutting (dead) meat, which is also permitted on Shabbat. However, the last fact is not universally accepted: a non-viable child is compared to non-viable animal fetus, about which there is a disagreement whether it is considered alive for slaughter.
