 A better derivation is from the words "and you will write" (uchtavtam) themselves, which can be translated as "complete writing" - that is, on the scroll, and not on the stones. Now that we have this direct derivation, what do we need the previous one for? - You might still think to engrave the words on a stone, then attach the stone to the doorpost. This teaches otherwise.
