 At times, besides the symbolic removal of the ashes, there was a real cleaning. What garments should this be performed in (they are called "other garments" in the Torah) - better or worse quality? Using the principle that "when a servant mixes wine for his master, he should not use the same garments as when he is preparing a dish for his master," we conclude that the removal of the ashes was done in better quality garments.
