 "A live dog is better than a dead lion" refers to the day when his father David (a lion) died. This happened on Shabbat, and a dead body on Shabbat is "muktzeh," "set aside," which cannot be handled. Besides, David's dogs were hungry, so Solomon asked the Sages what to do. They allowed Solomon to carry David's body in an unusual way, by placing on it a child or a loaf of bread. For the dogs, however, they allowed to cut the meat in the usual way.
