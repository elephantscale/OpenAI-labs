 One should not give clothing to a gentile launderer unless he has time to finish it while it is yet day - so say Beit Shammai, but Beit Hillel allow it - provided that the Jew does not ask for them right after Shabbat. In the household of Rabban Gamliel they would follow the stringency of Beit Shammai, while white clothes were given even more time - since they are harder to clean. Even though this is not the prevailing law, it does teach us about cleaning. Abaye once asked a launderer, "How much to clean the colored garment?" - and the launderer told him that it is the same as white ones. Abaye said to himself, "Talmud teaches that he is cheating!"
