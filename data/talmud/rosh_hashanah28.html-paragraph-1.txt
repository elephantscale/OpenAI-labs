 Another take from Rava: When does the misappropriation occur? - After he has blown the shofar! When he was blowing, the shofar was still the property of the Temple, and the blowing is invalid. Thus, in both cases, it is invalid. Rava then reversed his opinion: in both cases, the blowing is valid. Why? The concept of benefit does not apply to mitzvot; instead, they are a yoke on one's neck. Thus, there is really no benefit and, consequently, no transgression involved in either case and in both cases, his blowing fulfills the mitzvah.
