Menachot 53- Rabbi Preida Consoles Rabbi Ezra The students said to Rabbi Preida, "Rabbi Ezra, who is a tenth generation from Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, who was in turn a tenth-generation descendant of Ezra the Scribe, is standing at the door." Rabbi Preida said, "Why do I need his genealogy? If he is a scholar who achieved his knowledge by himself - great! And if he was assisted by the merit of his fathers - also great! Let him come in."
