Niddah 67 - A Woman Immerses in a Mikveh When a woman immerses in a mikveh, nothing must separate between her body and the water. This is derived from the immersion of a metzora, spiritual leper, about whom the Torah says, "and he will immerse his flesh in water." Since the immersion is done in water as a matter of course, then the word "water" teaches exactly that law, that nothing should interpose between him and the water. Thus, there is a requirement to examine one's body and hair for interposition. In addition, the Sages established that a woman should also scrub, or shampoo, her hair before immersion.
