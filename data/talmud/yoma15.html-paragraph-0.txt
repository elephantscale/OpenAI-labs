Yoma 15 - Attention to detail Earlier, in describing the order of the day of the High Priest in preparation for Yom Kippur, we mentioned that he would "burn the incense and prepare the Menorah." We can assume that every day the service follows this order. If so, we have a problem: the order of the Tractate "Tamid" service, which is specifically dedicated to Temple procedure, is listed differently: first the Menorah and then the incense.
