Yoma 87 - Saying "excuse me" On Yom Kippur, one is supposed to apologize for his wrongdoings, in front of God and in front of the people whom he may have wronged. In fact, when one apologizes before God, even his willful wrongdoings are considered mere mistakes. What is the proof? - from the phrase "Returnâ€¦ you have stumbled in your iniquity." Iniquity is something done on purpose, yet here it is called "stumbled."
