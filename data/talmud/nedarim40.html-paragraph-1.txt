 Rabbi Akiva noticed that one of his students did not attend the classes. He visited the student and found him sick and in a dirty, dusty room. Rabbi Akiva cleaned the room and cared for the student - some say that because of this visit, the innkeeper started watching for the student more - and the student recovered. The student told Rabbi Akiva, "Teacher, you brought me back to life!" Rabbi Akiva then taught that one who does not visit the sick is as if he spills blood.
