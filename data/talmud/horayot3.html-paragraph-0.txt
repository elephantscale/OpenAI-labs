Horayot 3 - Only Jews in Israel Count for Majority The previous rule that one is not liable if he followed the erroneous decision of the court is the minority opinion; the prevailing opinion is that one IS liable in such case. However, if the majority of Jews acted on a court's error - who ruled, for example, that a certain action is not idol worship when in reality it is - then each individual is not liable, and instead the court brings the sacrifice for the mistake they had made. The majority in this case is determined only among the Jews living in Israel.
