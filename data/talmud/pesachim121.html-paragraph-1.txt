 Before eating each of these sacrifices, one would have to say the blessing appropriate to it, such as "â€¦ Who has sanctified us and commanded to eat a holiday offering." However, if one said the blessing on the Passover lamb, that already includes both blessings - these are the words of Rabbi Ishmael. Rabbi Akiva argues and says that not one of these two blessings includes the other. The essence of the disagreement goes back to the way these offerings were brought in the Temple. One required "throwing the blood," while the other - just "putting the blood on the Altar." According to Rabbi Ishmael, pouring includes such actions as throwing, and accordingly, one blessing covers both, but according to Rabbi Akiva, these are independent actions.
