Shekalim 14 - The knowledge of foreign languages One of the Temple's administrators we mentioned before, Petachia, was really Mordechai of the Purim festival. Still, he is called Petachia (one who opens) because he knew all foreign languages (denoted as the symbolic number of 70 languages). Moreover, he could understand what people meant when they would mix these languages together.
