Temurah 14 - Is It Permitted To Write Down The Talmud? There are differences between personal and communal sacrifices: one can make (forbidden) exchange with personal sacrifices but not with communal ones; personal offering can be males or females, but communal offerings are always males; personal offerings that need to be brought at specific times (for example, of a Nazir) must be brought even if its time has passed, but communal offering need not be brought after their time has passed. On the other hand, communal offerings can be brought on Shabbat, and even in the state of impurity, but personal offerings cannot.
