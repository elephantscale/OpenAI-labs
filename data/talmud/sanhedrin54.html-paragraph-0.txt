Sanhedrin 54 - Why is the Animal Also Stoned? The law is that the animal with whom bestiality was committed is also stoned. What is the reason for this strange law? If the person sinned, in what way did the animal sin? - Since the downfall came upon a man through it, it is also stoned, so that others should not come to sin through it as well. Another explanations: so that it should not occur that an animal passes in the street and people say, "This is the one that caused So-and-so to be stoned."
