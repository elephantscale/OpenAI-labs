 However, for slaughtering on Shabbat, he deserves stoning. We would expect that he gets the toughest of the punishments and does not have to pay. And yet, Rabbi Meir requires him to pay four- or five-fold. Our solution: he does not slaughter the animal himself; instead, he instructs someone to do it. He is indeed liable for stealing the animal, slaughtering it, and selling the meat, because just as selling is done with the help of another, so can slaughter be done through an agent - but he himself did not violate Shabbat, so he is not stoned. (There is also an explanation for the opinion of the Sages, who do not punish him at all).
