Meilah 22 - Money-changer And Storekeeper If one deposited money with a money-changer, and it was tied up in a bundle, the money-changer may not use it. Therefore, if the money-changer spent the money, and it was later discovered that it belonged to the Temple, he is liable for misappropriation. However, if the money was loose, the money-changer may use it, and if it was the Temple's, it is the depositor who is guilty of misappropriation. The money-changer's main occupation is to deal with money, and it is presumed that he has the permission to use the loose coins deposited with him.
