Brachot 2 - Saying the Shema Prayer Twice a day, evening and morning, one must say that he will listen to God and love God. This is the Shema prayer, "Listen, Israel, God is our Lord, God is One." Since the Torah continues, "when you lie down and when you get up," we understand that this paragraph needs to be said twice.
