 There is one exception for the above rules: one may bring up (water with a pail) for the vegetables, to eat them on the Holidays. Ravina and Rabbah were traveling along the road on a particular holiday weekday, and they saw a man who was drawing water with a pail and watering his vegetable patch. Rabbah said to Ravina, "Let's excommunicate him for violating the law!" Ravina answered, "but we may draw up for vegetables in order to eat them." Rabbah asked, "Is that how you understand 'bring up'? No! - This means, thinning out the vegetable by 'bringing up' the extra ones, which don't let the others to grow." Ravina showed him an example where "bringing up" meant bringing up water, and Rabbah said, "I agree with your proof and retract my opinion."
