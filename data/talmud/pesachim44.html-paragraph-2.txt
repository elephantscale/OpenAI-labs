 This dip is meant to be eaten as a condiment. When one eats it, he does not reach the olive's bulk of bread in the normal eating period, and he is not liable from the Torah point of view. On the other hand, if he decides to gulp the dip, he is not eating like people normally eat. This is not considered an act of eating either - and Torah only prohibits eating chametz by swallowing it normally.
