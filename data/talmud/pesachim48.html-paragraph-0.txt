Pesachim 48 - Another "since"? On the previous page, we discussed baking bread (unleavened, of course) close to the end of a holiday, when one is full and cannot eat what he will bake. However, since should the guests chance, they will come and eat his bread, he is not liable for using the Holiday to prepare for a weekday. The principle of "since" had a champion in Rabbah, but Rav Chisda did not accept this way of reasoning.
