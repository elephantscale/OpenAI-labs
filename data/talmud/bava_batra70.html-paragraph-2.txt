 What is the rule if one records making his deposit in a document, and the custodian tells him, "I have already returned it to you"? Do we say that if the custodian wished to lie, he could have said that the deposit suffered an unavoidable mishap, in which case he would have been believed? Therefore, we believe him on the strength of "why would he lie?" argument?
