Yoma 11 - Mezuzah for all Since the Torah said, "Write the words about God on the doorposts of your house and on your gates," we understand that just as the gates of your house are included, so too the gates of your courtyards, provinces, and cities. However, just as a house, it should be inhabited. For example, strictly speaking, a synagogue requires a mezuzah only if the sexton (gabbai) lives there.
