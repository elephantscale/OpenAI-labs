 The regular vestments of a Kohen consisted of four items: a tunic, breeches, a turban, and a belt. The High Priest had eight, adding the breastplate, the "ephod" (apron), the golden plate worn on the forehead. When they needed to know God's advice by consulting Urim VeTumim, these vestments were required.
