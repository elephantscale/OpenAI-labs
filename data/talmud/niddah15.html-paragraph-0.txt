Niddah 15 - The Wife is Always Pure All women are presumed to be pure for their husbands: a wife may cohabit with her husband without performing an examination. The checks that were learned about before were only instituted for women involved in preparation of ritually pure foods, in the time of the Temple and for some time afterward. Furthermore, the husband does not have to ask his wife if she is a niddah. Those man who come home from a journey can also presume that their wives are pure.
