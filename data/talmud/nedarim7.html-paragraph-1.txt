 Rabbi Akiva struggled with this case, and even though he might rule stringently and maintain that this creates a vow, he still remained in doubt. This meant that there would be no punishment for violating such vow. Most of the time, when people use the word "excommunicate," they mean a religious disciplinary measure, not a vow to abstain from dealing with one's fellow.
