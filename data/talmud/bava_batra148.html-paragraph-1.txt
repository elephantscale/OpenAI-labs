 If a seriously ill person announced that all of his possessions should go to a certain person, but then changed his mind, saying that some possessions should go to someone else, what is the law? Has the ill person retracted his entire gift to the first person, or has he retracted only the part of the gift that he explicitly willed to someone else?
