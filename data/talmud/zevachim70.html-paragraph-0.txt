Zevachim 70 - Ritual Impurity of Birds According to Rabbi Yehudah Rabbi Yehudah has said that if a Kohen did a melikah to a bird and then the bird was found to be a "trefah" - possessing a defect that would surely cause its death anyway - that bird imparts ritual impurity. Why does he say so? After all, Rabbi Meir compared this to the slaughter of animals, where the slaughter does remove the impurity.
