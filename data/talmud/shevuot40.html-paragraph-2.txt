 Rava said: "The precise reading of the ruling indicates the opinion of Rav, but the words of the Torah sound like the opinion of Shmuel." The precise reading of the ruling seems to agree with Rav, because it says that the minimum amount of "the claim" must be 2 maot, but never mentions how much the denied amount should be, which means that by "claim" the ruling means "the denial". The Torah, however, sounds closer to the opinion of Shmuel, when it says "this is it!" indicating that the amount of claim itself is important when it is 2 coins.
