Shabbat 23 - Being above suspicion What is the actual mitzvah of Hanukkah: kindling the lights or putting the already burning menorah in its place? For example, there is a rule that if one was standing and holding his menorah all the required time, he accomplished absolutely nothing. But he kindled it and it was burning! Do we see from here that placing the lamp is essential, and that is what he failed to do? - Not necessarily. Here the problem is that those who see him might say, "He needs the light for his own needs," and he thus fails to publicize the miracle.
