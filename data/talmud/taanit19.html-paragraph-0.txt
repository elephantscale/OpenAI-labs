Taanit 19 - Nakdimon Ben Gurion The series of fasts that we have spoken about earlier are only for rains that are coming late. The rationale is that this is a gradual worsening of the situation, which can be fixed. However, for serious calamities they fast and cry out right away. What is considered a serious calamity? If the crops grew abnormally and may be totally ruined, if the rains fell irregularly (too strong or too weak), or any other natural or economic condition which may result in a dangerous food shortage.
