Avodah Zarah 69 - The Saga of Mouse Continued Assuming that the flavor that a mouse gives to beer is beneficial, what is the law if it falls into vinegar? There was such a case in Rav Kahana's household, and he prohibited it. Do we see from here that the mouse indeed gives a beneficial flavor, and that's why he prohibited it? - No, but in that case small pieces of the mouse remained in vinegar, and since one gets lashes for eating a smaller piece of a mouse than other non-kosher foods, he prohibited it for this reason.
