 How do we know that? In fact, we might even think the opposite. The Torah stated that a sacrifice kept overnight is burned and one that goes out of the Temple is also burned. Therefore I might think that since the sacrifice on the private altar already exited the Temple and was not burned, so too one that was left overnight is not burned! - Bird sacrifices disprove this, since they are less strict than the animal sacrifices, and they do become invalid with time. - Birds are no proof, because they require a kohen. To dispel all these arguments, the Torah said, "This is the law of the peace offerings" - to be applied both inside and outside the Temple.
