Shevuot 47 - One, Who Has to Take an Oath but Cannot, Pays If the defendant has to take an oath, such as when he agrees that he owes half of the amount and has to swear about the other half, but cannot, because he once swore falsely, the oath is shifted to his opponent, the plaintiff. If, however, the plaintiff is also not trustworthy, then the rule is that "the oath returns to its place."
