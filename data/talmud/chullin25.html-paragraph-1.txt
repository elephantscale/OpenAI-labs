 How do we know this highly unusual law of earthenware utensils? The Torah said, "an earthenware utensil into whose interior one of the eight dead reptiles will fall â€¦ will become impure" - even if the reptile does not touch it. It also said,"any open utensil under the same roof with a dead body, if it does not have a cover, will become impure", to teach that if it does have a cover, it remains pure and protects from impurity - even if it is touched from the outside.
