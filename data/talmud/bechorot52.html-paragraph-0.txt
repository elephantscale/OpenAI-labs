Bechorot 52 - Firstborn Gets Double Firstborn son gets a double portion in the inheritance from his father's estate, but not from his mother's. The Torah said, "to him applies the law of the firstborn." Even though it is talking here about him, the son, it also hints that this law applies only to "him", the father, and not to "her", the mother.
