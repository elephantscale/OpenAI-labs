Meilah 13 - Eggs And Milk Milks of sacrificial animals, and eggs of turtledoves - there is not misappropriation for them: since they are not fit for the Altar, they are not considered as "holies of God." However, the Sages decreed not to use them. That is true for actual sacrifices, but something consecrated to the Temple's treasury, which cannot be brought on the Altar itself - like chicken or she-donkey - their eggs and milk are subject to misappropriation prohibition.
