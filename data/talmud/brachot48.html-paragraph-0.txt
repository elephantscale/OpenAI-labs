Brachot 48 - When not to join in prayer Earlier we learned that if three people ate together, they must invite each other for an after-meal prayer. This invitation is called "zimun." However, there are cases when they should not combine - such as when one of them ate food that was not kosher. A learned person should not join unlearned boors.
