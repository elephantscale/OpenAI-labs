 That rule sounds a bit strange: can we assume, for example, that a deranged person fulfills the requirement of writing a Get having in his mind that it is for a specific woman? - We have to say that someone who knows watches him and commands him what to do. What about signatures of the witness? - We know that the law is like Rabbi Elazar, that it is the witnesses of giving the Get who matter!? - True, the rule assumes that the signing witnesses will be there for the continuation of the proceedings and will witness the giving of the Get as well, as is usually the case.
