Niddah 31 - Cleopatra's Experiment Rabbi Ishmael disagrees with the forty days for forming the fetus rule above and says that the male forms in forty days, but the female forms in eighty days.

She had them cohabit on the same day, then examined them on the forty-first day: one had a male, another a female, both formed. Rabbi Ishmael answered, "I am bringing a proof from the Torah, and you are responding with a proof from imbeciles!"
