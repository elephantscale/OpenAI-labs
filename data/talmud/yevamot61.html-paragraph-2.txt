 If a Kohen betrothed a widow (whom he is allowed to marry) and was appointed a High Priest, he could fully marry her (which would not be allowed for a regular High Priest). This is learned from the words "... only a virgin shall he take," where the words "shall he take" are extra, alluding to a particular case where he marries a widow.
