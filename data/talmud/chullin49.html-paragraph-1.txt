 Abomasum is the fourth and final division in the stomach of a cow. If it was punctured, the animal is terefah. Incidentally, the kohanim, who receive this abomasum with its rennet as one of the gifts due them, have adopted the practice of allowing this fat for consumption, following Rabbi Ishmael, who is also a kohen. He also explains the order of blessings to their benefit, as: they bless the people, and God blesses them.
