Pesachim 93 - How far is far? We learned that if one happens to be far away from the Temple on Passover and cannot bring and eat a Passover offering, he can do it thirty days later, on Pesach Sheni. We also said that "too far" is the distance one can travel on foot on Passover's eve, starting out in the morning and arriving at the Temple in the afternoon.
