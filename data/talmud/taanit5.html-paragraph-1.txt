 But we learned that the proper time for the early rain is a few months before, in Marcheshvan!? - this event happened only once, in the time of Joel, after the seven-year drought. People asked Joel, should they plant the small amount of seed they had - and die before the crop sprouts? He told them to plant nevertheless. A miracle happened to them, and new wheat grew in just eleven days so that they could bring the Omer sacrifice - and start eating the grain right away. This is what the phrase "Those who sow with tears will reap with joy" means. In fact, as an ox drew the plow going one way and sowing, the grain already began to grow, so it could already eat the new growth on the way back. The ears of grain were then two times longer than the stalk.
