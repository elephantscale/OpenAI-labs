 Here is one example of such teachings: "The Chayot (literally, live beings) angels ran to and fro, like the appearance of broken fire." This can be understood that they were raising their heads above their level but then immediately drawing them back out of fear of Divine presence. This phrase also teaches a meditative device of swinging between extremes in the perception of the Divine, like a pendulum, gradually expanding its swing.
