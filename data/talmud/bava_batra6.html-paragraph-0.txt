Bava Batra 6 - Privacy on the Roof If two homes are standing on two opposite sides of a public domain, both owners must make a fence of four amot (about 6 feet) high across half of his roof. The fences must not be directly opposite each other, but each must cover the adjoining side, preventing his neighbor from looking directly into his roof, and preventing him from looking into his neighbor's roof. Furthermore, the fences must be slightly longer than half the roof, thus further obstructing the view.
