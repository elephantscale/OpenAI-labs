 To illustrate, later there was a story when Rava was returning from a lecture he had delivered on Shabbat, surrounded by throngs of people, and his attendant used this live partition to bring back some flasks that were left in the public square. However, when on the next Shabbat the attendant wanted to do the same, Rava forbade it, because now people were aware that they were used as a human partition.
