 The redeemed animal cannot be shorn or put to work, and its milk is prohibited. Why? The Torah said, "you may slaughter it" - but not shear it or work with it, "for its meat" - but not drink its milk. Finally, "and you will eat" teaches that you may not give it to your dogs. In general, an animal that's once been a consecrated may not be redeemed with the purpose of feeding it to the dogs.
