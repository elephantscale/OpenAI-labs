 This law applies primarily to a young girl who just became a bat mitzvah (12 years) and thus an adult but has not become a more grown-up (12 Â½ years). The penalty still applies if he rapes a girl who is a mamzer and whom he is prohibited from marrying. It also applies to all who were converted or ransomed before they were three years of age.
