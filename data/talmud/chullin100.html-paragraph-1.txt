 What happens when a non-kosher food cooks together with kosher food and is not nullified in one-in-sixty, making the whole mixture prohibited? Do we view it as basically kosher food, with too much taste of non-kosher one, or do we view the entire mixture as completely new non-kosher entity? The practical difference between the two points of view arises when the mixture falls into a large pot, and we need to know if it is now nullified or not? The law follows the second alternative.
