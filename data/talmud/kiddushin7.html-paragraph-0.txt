Kiddushin 7 - Cash Flow If a woman suggests to a man, "Give money to so-and-so and I will thereby become betrothed to you," and the man gives the money as specified and says the formula, the woman becomes betrothed, through the principle of a guarantor. A guarantor of a loan, even though he does not personally receive the benefit, still binds himself to repay. So too she commits herself, in return for the money based on her say-so.
