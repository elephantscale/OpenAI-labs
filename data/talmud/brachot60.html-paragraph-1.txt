 It once happened the Hillel was coming along the road, and as he heard screaming in the city, he said, "I am confident that this is not in my house." To Hillel the following verse applies, "Of evil things he will not have fear; his heart is firm, confident in God." In general, one should not worry too much, because this only betrays his own insecurities and wrongdoings. However, what about king Solomon's statement that "Praiseworthy is the man who is always fearful"? - that is talking about one who worries not to forget his learning.
