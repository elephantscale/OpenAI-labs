Arachin 2 - Personal Valuations to the Temple One can make a personal valuation vow to the Temple, promising to donate his own or someone else's value. Furthermore, one can promise either a monetary value - the price that this person could fetch in a slave market - or a symbolic value, expressed in shekel coins, in the amount prescribed by the Torah.
