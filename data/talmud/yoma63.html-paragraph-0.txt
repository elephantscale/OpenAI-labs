Yoma 63 - High Priest who ignored the lots Earlier, we learned the proper procedure of drawing the lots for the goats: the lot determines which goat is for the Name and which goat for Azazel. What if one instead took the two goats outside the Temple and slaughtered them there? Since these were bought with Temple funds, they became sanctified as a sacrifice at the point of sale. And since he is now slaughtering a sacrifice outside the Temple, he deserves the punishment of karet (excision) for each goat. However, if the High Priest drew the lots, and then he sacrificed the goats, he is liable for only one goat - the one designated for the Name, but not the one for Azazel. Granted that the goats belong to the Temple, but what specific service are they fit for, so that bringing them as a sacrifice would qualify for the offense of "sacrifice brought outside?" The answer is that there will be a goat offering in the "mussaf' - additional offerings later today; these two goats can potentially qualify as such offering. Art: Two Goat by Adrien Dauzats
