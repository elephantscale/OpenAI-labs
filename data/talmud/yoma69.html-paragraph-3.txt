 In proving that one can indeed sit in the Women's Courtyard, the Talmud quotes a phrase from Nehemiah. It then continues with the events of that time. The Sages observed that the Evil Inclination has already succeeded in convincing people to worship idols, which led to the First Temple's destruction, and they fasted and prayed for three days for God to remove it. They were given this, and it came out of the Holy of Holies in the form of the roaring lion made of fire. They hid it away in a special magical vessel made of lead, and the desire to worship idols was much weakened.
