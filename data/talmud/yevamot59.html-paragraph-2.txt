 On the other hand, Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon understand "virginity" as already denoting complete virginity. Then the next word "her virginity" relaxes the law and allows more mature age. Therefore, the third word, "in," again makes the law stricter and requires all her virginity to be extant, excluding unnatural (anal) intercourse, which accordingly disqualifies her.
