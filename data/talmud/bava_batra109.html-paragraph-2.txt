 The passages of the Torah describing the laws of inheritance do not mention the father of the deceased at all. However, in the phrase "...You shall give his inheritance to HIS RELATIVE who is closest to him of his family..." - "his relative" means the father of the deceased. Now that we see that the father is mentioned, his place in the chain of inheritance is right after the children, because one's father is considered a closer relative to him than his siblings are.
