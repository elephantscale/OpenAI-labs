 But did Rabbi Elazar really say this? Didn't he say the opposite in the following ruling: "If one separated first fruit before Sukkot, and Sukkot has passed, and he didn't bring the first fruit, they must be left to rot." Why is this? Isn't it because the owner can no longer say the verses over them? This proves that Rabbi Elazar considers the verses essential!
