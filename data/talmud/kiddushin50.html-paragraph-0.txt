Kiddushin 50 - Betrothal by a Liar If a man says to a woman, "Become betrothed to me on condition that I am a Kohen," but he is found to be a Levi, or the reverse - even if the woman later says "In my heart I intended to become betrothed to him nevertheless," - she is not betrothed. Unexpressed intentions are not recognized in Jewish law.
