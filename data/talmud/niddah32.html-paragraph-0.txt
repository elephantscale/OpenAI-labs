Niddah 32 - Cutheans Cutheans were a people brought by the Assyrian emperor Shalmanessar from their native Cutha to Israel to populate the area of Israel left desolate by his exile of the Ten Tribes. Since then lived in Samaria, they are also called Samaritans. While in Israel, they were attacked by mountain lions, and they decided to convert to Judaism. They basically followed the written Torah the way they understood it, and in these areas they were even more meticulous than the Jews. However, they differed in matters of interpretation, which caused them to observe some laws incorrectly. Eventually, it was discovered that they still served idols, and they were declared to be non-Jewish, but prior to that they were a subject of long-standing disagreements.
