Shabbat 116 - Eighty-five letters What is the smallest book in the Torah? - Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that it is the phrase "When the Ark went forth, Moses said, 'Arise, O God, and scatter your enemies! Let your foes flee before You!'...'" which contains eighty-five letters. If this phrase is indeed a separate book, then the Book of Numbers contains not one but three books - before this phrase, after it, and the phrase itself, and the total number of the books in the Torah is seven.
