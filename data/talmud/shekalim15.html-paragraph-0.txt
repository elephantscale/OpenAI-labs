Shekalim 15 - The chamber of secrets One who brought a sacrifice in the Temple would first go to the administrator over tokens (Yochanan), pay the money for the oil and wine required with his sacrifice, and receive a token. He would then take the token to the administrator over the supplies (Achiya) and receive the proper amounts. In the evening, Yochanan and Achiya would meet and reconcile the tokens and the money. If any money was lacking, Yochanan had to repay his own because of the rule that "Temple always has precedence." There were four types of tokens for various groups of sacrifices.
