Nedarim 86 - Who made the vow? If one thought that his wife made a vow, and he revoked it, and then it turned out that it was his daughter who made this vow - he must now revoke it for his daughter. His original revocation for this wife does not count. Similarly, if he thought that his wife vowed to abstain from grapes, and it turns out that she wanted to abstain from figs, he needs to do the revocation once more.
