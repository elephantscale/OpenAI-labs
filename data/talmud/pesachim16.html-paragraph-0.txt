Pesachim 16 - What did Rabbi Akiva add? Rabbi Akiva added to Rabbi Chanina's testimony by stating, "Kohanim had no problem burning oil that was only slightly ritually impure in a lamp that was more ritually impure." How is that an addition to what Rabbi Chanina had said? Both state that one can add to the already existing impurity when the food is anyway being destroyed? And actually, what new did Rabbi Chanina say in the first place? Food can not make other food impure anyway!?
