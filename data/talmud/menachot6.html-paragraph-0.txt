Menachot 6 - Non-Kohen Cannot Do the Flour Service If a non-Kohen performs the service of taking off a handful from a flour offering, this offering becomes invalid. The same is true if the service has been performed by a mourner, by an impure person even if he went to the mikvah and will be pure at night, by a kohen who lacks some of the priestly garments, by one who has not washed his hands and a feet, who is uncircumcised, is sitting, or is standing on his colleague's feet.
