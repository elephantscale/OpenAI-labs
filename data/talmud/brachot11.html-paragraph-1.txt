 Rabbi Tarfon said, "I was once on the road, and when the time for the evening Shema came, I lay down, to fulfill the words of Beit Shammai, and I almost came in danger because of the robbers." His colleagues told him, "It would have been your own fault, for transgressing the words of Beit Hillel."
