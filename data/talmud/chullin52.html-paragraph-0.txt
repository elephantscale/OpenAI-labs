Chullin 52 - Clawed by a Wolf If most of the ribs of an animal are broken, that animal is terefah. Rav Kahana and Rav Assi had two questions for Rav, which they wisely combined into one: "If a rib on one side of a vertebra and on another side was uprooted, what is the law?" They also wanted to know about one rib, but figured that if Rav gets angry when answering their question, then even one rib makes it a terefah. Rav answered, "That animal is split in half! It is nevelah!" This was a form of getting angry, and they had their two answers.
