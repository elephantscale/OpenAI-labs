 Next question: a mouse with bread enters the house, and then a weasel exits, and in its mouth, there is a mouse and a piece of bread. If you tell me that this is for sure the same bread, I will counter and tell you that the bread should be in the mouse's mouth, and the mouse should be in the weasel's mouth. To which you can still answer that perhaps the mouse got scared of the weasel and dropped the bread, and then the weasel picked up both. To this last question, the Talmud does not find a definitive answer.
