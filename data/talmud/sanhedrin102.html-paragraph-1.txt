 The arrogance of Yarovam was the cause of his downfall, despite his initial greatness in Torah learning. As a king who was not a descendant of David, Yarovam would have to stand in the Temple Courtyard, while the king who was a true descendant would sit. Yarovam preferred to stop his subjects from pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and established two golden calves for worship instead. Any time a punishment comes to the nation of Israel, it contains a small measure of the punishment for the first Golden Calf; after Yarovam, there were two more.
