Keritot 14 - One Meal, Five Transgressions One can eat a piece of food and be liable for four sin-offerings and a guilt-offering: if he was ritually impure and ate prohibited fat, which was left over from sacrifices, on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Meir says that if it was Shabbat and he carried food in this mouth, he is liable for a fifth sin-offering, but the Sages respond that it doesn't come it, since it is a different group of prohibitions.
