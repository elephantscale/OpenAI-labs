 The beginning of the phrase says that impure meat is not eaten. So we understand that doubtfully impure meat can be eaten. But the end talks about pure meat that may be eaten.

You can only explain it if you say that the doubt is prohibited when it refers to a human, who can be asked, and allowed if it refers to the meat itself, which obviously cannot be questioned.
