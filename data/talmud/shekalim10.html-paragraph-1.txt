 Some money would still remain in the chamber, and, being that their mitzvah was already accomplished, the money could be used for the goat of Yom Kippur and for the city walls and towers. If any money was still left, the Temple could use it for commerce - says Rabbi Ishmael. However, Rabbi Akiva says that it would be degrading. He also says that surplus money from donations to the poor cannot be used for commerce but must be held for any contingency. Rabbi Akiva himself was a charity administrator.
