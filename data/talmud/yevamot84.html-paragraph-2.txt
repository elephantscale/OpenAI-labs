 A non-trivial example of the second category is this. A regular Israel married an illegitimate woman (mamzeret). He has a brother who is himself a mamzer. An ordinary Israel cannot marry a mamzeret, but a mamzer can. Thus, we have a case of a woman who is forbidden to her husband but is permitted to her yavam.
