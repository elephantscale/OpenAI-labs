Shekalim 3 - Also on the first of Adar Another announcement that happened on the first of Adar was about kilaim - growing different species, such as grapes and wheat, together. There is a parallel kilaim prohibition of wearing wool and linen together (representing Abel the shepherd and Cain the earth tiller.) The separation between the two helps rectify Cain's murder, which somewhat explains the mitzvah.
