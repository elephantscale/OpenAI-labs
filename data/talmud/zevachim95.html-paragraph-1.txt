 Similar law applies to an earthenware utensil, except that if it becomes impure while outside, it cannot be broken - since breaking must be inside. Instead, one punctures a small hole in it, which makes it unusable and leads it to loose its impurity, then brings it into the Courtyard and breaks it there.
