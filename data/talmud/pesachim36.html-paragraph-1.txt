 Fruit and grain that ripens first is called "first fruit" and is brought to Jerusalem and is eaten there by the priests. Can the priests make matzah out of that? - No, since the Torah said, "You will eat matzah in all your dwellings," that is, matzah must be fit to be eaten everywhere, and the first fruit flour is fit to be eaten only in Jerusalem.
