Bechorot 27 - Kohen Helping on the Threshing Floor If a Kohen says to a Jew who is caring for a firstborn, "Give it to me before the prescribed time; you will have it off your hands, and I will now care for it" - the Jew is not allowed to do it. Why not? Because that kohen will appear as working for a reward. The firstborn animal is a gift, and it must be given freely and in a dignified manner. This is similar to a Kohen who would help on the threshing floor to later get his portion (terumah), or a Levite in a like situation, to get his tithe, and the Torah said, "Do not profane the holies of the Children of Israel, so that you will not die."
