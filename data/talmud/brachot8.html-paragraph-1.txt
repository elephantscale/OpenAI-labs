 The phrase "Pray to God when He is (easily) found" can also be understood as "Pray to God when you need to find (something)." What is this something one should pray for? - A good wife, as Solomon said, "One who found a wife found goodness." Some say, this is Torah, about which Solomon said "He who find me finds life." And some say, easy death when his time comes. The hardest death is similar to pulling branches of thorns from a ball of wool shearings, and the easiest is like removing a hair from milk.
