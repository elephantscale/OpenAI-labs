Avodah Zarah 76 - Purifying a Knife To purify a non-kosher knife, one wipes it, and it is clean. Rav Ukva bar Chama explained this to mean that he sticks the knife into the ground ten times. In addition, the ground has to be hard and not ploughed, and the knife - smooth, without dents. This only suffices to purify the knife to be used with cold foods.
