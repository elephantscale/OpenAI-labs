Gittin 17 - When Rabba bar bar Channa got sick When Rabba bar bar Channa got sick, the Sages came to visit him, and while there, asked a question: "If two messengers brought a Get, do they still need to say that it was written and signed in front of them?" He said, "No, they don't." He then presented a new argument: "If they testified that the husband divorced her, they would be believed, no? So we should believe them that the Get is valid."
