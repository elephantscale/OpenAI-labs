 When is an animal given to a harlot as payment tithed? - When he buys it back. But the sale removes the animal from tithes!? - He gave and re-purchased a fetus. But let the harlot tithe the animal herself!? - She is a Cuthean harlot who, not being Jewish, does not have to tithe. But why not teach us a case of a Jewish harlot? - Only a harlot whom he cannot marry has her payment forbidden, but if marriage could take effect, her payment can be brought as tithe in the Temple.
