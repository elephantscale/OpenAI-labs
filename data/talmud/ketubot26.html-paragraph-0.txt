Ketubot 26 - A woman in prison If a woman was imprisoned by the idolaters because of money matters - that is, she owed them money - then she is permitted to her husband (the Kohen) after her release. Since by molesting her, they would be found guilty and may forfeit their rights to the money, they would be careful and refrain.
