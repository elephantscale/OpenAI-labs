 Consider the case where a house collapsed on a son and his mother. Since it is not known who died first, the paternal brothers of the son claim that perhaps the mother died first, the son inherited her, and they should inherit him. The mother's relatives (for example, her paternal brothers) claim that perhaps the son died first, so he never inherited anything, and therefore they inherit the estate.
