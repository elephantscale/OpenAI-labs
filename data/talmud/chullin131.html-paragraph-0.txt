Chullin 131 - One Who Damages or Eats the Kohen's Gifts We learned that the foreleg, jaw, and abomasum of a slaughtered animal are a kohen's portion and should be given to him. However, Rav Chisda said that if one damages or eats these gifts, he does not have to pay. That is because the Torah said "This shall be his due" - meaning, only while "this" due is extant. The Talmud challenges Rav Chisda's ruling seven times, but Rav Chisda defends it each and every time.
