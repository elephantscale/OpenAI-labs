Eruvin 7 - Strict or lenient The people in Nahardea had a practical case similar to the one we learned before, except that their alleyway had two bends, not one. The Sages of Nehardea told them an unexpectedly strict ruling: they had to put up two doors, one at each of the two bends. This followed the strictness of Rav, who required the door shape (although not an actual door), but also the strictness of Shmuel, who in a different situation required an actual door, although he did not need it in the case of a bent alley.
