 If one sells grain to his fellow, the buyer accepts upon himself one quarter of a kav in a se'ah measure, which translates into 1/24; for figs he accepts ten wormy ones per one hundred; for a cellar of wine he accepts ten barrels of souring wine per hundred. All these are general guidelines in the absence of a prevailing local custom, however, if there is an accepted custom, then it is binding.
