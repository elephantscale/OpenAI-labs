 Said Rabbi Itzhak in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, "If one grants possession to a fetus, the fetus does not acquire." And if you question this from the Mishna which validated such an acquisition, that Mishna was talking about one's own children. Since one feels especially close to them, his resolve to give is strong enough, but this is not so for someone else's children.
