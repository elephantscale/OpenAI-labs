 Rav was once going to the house of his son-in-law and saw a ferry coming toward him. He said, "It is an omen that there will be a festival where I stay." When everyone came to great him, he himself kept watching the meat. Then he said to the butchers, "If not for me, you would have fed prohibited meat to my family!"
