 Chizkiyah taught a rule: if a law has no application in its context, use it in another context. For example, the Torah said "Every flour offering... will be for the sons of Aharon." Since we already know this from "this is the law of the flour offering," this teaches instead other laws: that a kohen cannot exchange his portion of the flour offering for a meat or bird offering.
