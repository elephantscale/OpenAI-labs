The general who came to destroy Jerusalem was Nebuzaradan. He had three hundred mule-loads of axes that cut iron, but one gate of Jerusalem swallowed them all. Nebuzaradan wanted to retreat, but the Heavenly voice told him, "You always wanted to destroy Jerusalem, now is your chance." With the wooden handle of a hatchet he then destroyed all gates, conquered Jerusalem and burned the Temple.
