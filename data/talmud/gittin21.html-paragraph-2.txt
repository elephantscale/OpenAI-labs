 The answer is that there are two parts in the Get. The first one is the "active," or "explicit" part, which effects the divorce. It gives the names of the husband and wife, the place and the date. It also contains the key phrase "you are free to marry anyone". This "active" part was initially left out on the leaf, and only the secondary part was there. The active part was written in after the leaf was detached, so the Get was really written correctly.
