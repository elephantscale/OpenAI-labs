Sukkah 9 - Old sukkah A sukkah that is "old," that is, one that was built more than thirty days before the holiday of Sukkot, is invalid. The Torah said, "Sukkot is a festival to God for seven days." That is, the sukkah must be built expressly for the festival - so says The School of Shammai. However, Hillel's school rules that an old sukkah is completely valid. One should make a little adjustment to a small area of the roof (s'chach), which is sufficient. But what does Beit Hillel do with the phrase "festival for seven days"? - They say that it teaches one not to use the materials of the sukkah for any other purpose, for all seven days of the festival.
