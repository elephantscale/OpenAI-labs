 Therefore the first man was created alone, and also so that everyone should say, "For my sake the world was created" - and he should be careful not to bring about his downfall by committing a transgression. Now, perhaps you will say, "What need have we for all this trouble?" - If you were a witness and saw the event, you must testify. And perhaps you will say, "What need have we to incur responsibility for this man's blood?" - be secure, for "...when the wicked perish there is joy."
