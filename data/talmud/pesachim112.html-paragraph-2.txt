 Actually, Rabbi Akiva gave his son seven instructions, the one above and six more, some of which are "don't live in the city where a Sage is a mayor (because he will be engrossed in study and neglect the city)," "never enter even your own house suddenly, without giving an audible warning" and "engage in business with one who is enjoying good fortune (because his good luck may rub off on you)." The latter, however, is true only for partnership, but not to buy and sell from him - for he will get a better deal.
