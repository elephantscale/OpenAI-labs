 But now the word "razor" becomes extra: if, in the end, the Torah is going to prohibit all kinds of hair removal, then why mention "razor?" Now, this teaches an additional law: that when the nazir concludes his term and shaves his head, that shaving must be done only with a razor. If he uses any other instrument, the shaving does not count; he has to re-do the last thirty days of a nazir and shave again, this time correctly.
