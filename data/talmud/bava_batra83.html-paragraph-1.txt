 If the seller sold what was purported to be superior wheat, and it was found to be inferior, the buyer can retract. The seller might also want to void the sale if the price rises, but he does not have this option. It is not the case of a fraudulent sale, where both can retract. Rather, it is more akin to a case of price fraud, or overcharge, since the buyer did receive wheat, albeit of inferior quality.
