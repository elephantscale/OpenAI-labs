Bava Batra 2 - Privacy Rights in a Courtyard Observing one's activities is considered a form of trespass on his domain. Thus, the Rabbi required that fences and walls be built between neighboring properties to prevent such violations. Private places, such as a person's home, where intimate acts are constantly performed, are clearly protected by the law of privacy. A courtyard, however, is considered a semi-private place.
