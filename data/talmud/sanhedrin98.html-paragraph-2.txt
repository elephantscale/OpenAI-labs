 The Messiah will come to the generation that is completely virtuous or completely sinful. If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to repent, because he focuses on his good attributes. On the other hand, one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's redemption.
