Sotah 5 - Haughty or humble? When one is haughty - God's presence in this world sheds tears because of all the tribulations that will eventually befall him. Moreover, when someone is arrogant, God says, "This world is too small for the two of us," or more precisely, "One who is haughty and proud - him I cannot bear (says God)."
