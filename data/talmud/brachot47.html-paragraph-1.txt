 Ravin and Abaye were once traveling on the road, and Ravin's donkey went ahead of Abaye's donkey. Abaye reasoned to himself, "Ever since this Rabbi (Ravin) returned from Israel, he became haughty." When they came to an entrance of a synagogue, Ravin said, "Let the master go in first." Abaye asked him, "And until now I was not the master?" However, Ravin answered by quoting Rabbi Yochanan - "We don't accord honor at the entrance unless it has a mezuzah." But the synagogue does not require a mezuzah!? - Ravin would explain, "Such an entrance that is fit for a mezuzah."
