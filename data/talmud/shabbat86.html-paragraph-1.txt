 The Torah had to be given to people who are ritually pure. All other sources of impurity can be eliminated by going to a mikveh, after which the person becomes ritually pure. Therefore, the only reason for the three-day waiting period was the potential for semen - if it is viable - to be expelled later, and the semen is considered viable for three days. The Talmud also discusses other opinions on how long this period can be.
