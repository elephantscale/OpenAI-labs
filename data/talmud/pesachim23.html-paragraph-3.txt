 After a few more such examples we cannot find where the rule of "don't eat, don't use" is ever applicable, and what is the difference between "don't eat" of Rabbi Abahu and "won't be eaten" of Chizkiyah. We finally find only one such case: an animal that was brought into the Temple and slaughtered there, even though it was not a sacrifice - and the difference is whether this meat can be sold or not.
