Chagigah 21 - How is one level of purity different from another? We mentioned that there are five levels of purity, each one higher than the other. However, this is not mentioned anywhere in the Torah, where a food or a person can by either ritually pure or not. (Even that is not practiced today, when there is no Temple and no ashes of red heifer).
