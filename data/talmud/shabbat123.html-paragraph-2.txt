 The laws of other utensils also depend on their intended use. For example, one may take a hammer, usually associated with forbidden work, and use it to break nuts; a shovel can be used to scoop dried figs from the bottom of the barrel; a pitchfork can be used to give food to a child who is stranded on the other side of the river; a hand needle may be used to remove a splinter and a sackmaker's needle may be used to open a door with it. What kind of hammer do we mean? One that is used for ordinary tasks, but not a blacksmith's hammer, since it is designated only for blacksmith's work. Others say that even a blacksmith's hammer may be used for the permitted work of cracking nuts. Similar disagreements exist in regard to all items listed above.
