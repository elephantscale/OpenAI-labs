Chullin 136 - Kohen's Gifts According to Rabbi Ilai When the Torah say "your" in singular, it refers both to each individual Jew, and to the whole Jewish people. Therefore, the law it discusses applies to an individual as well as to a partnership. For example, when it says, "The first of your (singular) fleece give to a kohen," this applies also to sheep of partners. Rabbi Ilai disagrees and holds that "your" in singular refers to an individual, but partners shearing their flock need not give the first fleece to a kohen.
