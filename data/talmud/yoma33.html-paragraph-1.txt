 On the Altar, there were two pyres of wood that the priests had to arrange every morning, a big one for the sacrifices, and a small one, for the ambers to burn the incense. The large one preceded the small one. Then came the separation of some ash from the Inner Alter, which preceded the cleaning of the five lamps of the Menorah. There were seven branches in the Menorah, but the preparation of the Menorah had to be broken into two phases. So first, they cleaned the five lamps and then, after an interruption, the remaining two. This interruption was provided by the slaughter and the throwing of the blood of the morning sacrifice. Then came the incense - which was before the burning of the sacrifice limbs - which was before the "mincha" flour offering.
