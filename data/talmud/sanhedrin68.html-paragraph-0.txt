Sanhedrin 68 - Wayward and Rebellious Son Rabbi Eliezer once taught Rabbi Akiba the act of magic with cucumbers: by saying a few words, he had planted a field full of cucumbers, and by saying a few other words he made them collect into one place. How was he allowed to practice witchcraft, if it says, "You shall not learn to do it"? - Because you can learn in order to understand and teach.
