 The Talmud suggests and refutes a hypothesis about impurity. If a dead reptile is found in an earthenware utensil, it makes the utensil impure. Can we view the utensil as being full of impurity, contaminating any food that is inside? - No, we cannot. The Torah said, "anything inside," which tells us that foods are impure by virtue of being inside. Thus, we have to say that the reptile touches the air, and the air touches the food, resulting in the transmission of impurity.
