Taanit 5 - Do children take after parents? Until when should one pray for rain? - Until the end of the rainy season, when rain is still beneficial - that is, until the end of Passover. Some say, until the very end of the month when Passover occurs, that is, Nissan - just as it happened once when "God made rainfall, early and late, in Nissan."
