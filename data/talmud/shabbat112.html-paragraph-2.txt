 Since the rule is that any knot that is tied and untied daily is permitted, then why did the Talmud have to give us all of the last examples? - They are all necessary. For example, in the case of a woman's chemise we are talking about a chemise with two straps, where we might have thought that she will tie one of them permanently, and only tie and untie the other ones - the Talmud thus informs us that we are not concerned about this possibility but rather assume that she will tie and untie both daily.
