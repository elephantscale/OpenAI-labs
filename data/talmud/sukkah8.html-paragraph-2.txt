 Can a sukkah be round? - No, because normal houses are not built like that. However, Rabbi Yochanan allows a round sukkah if it was large enough for twenty-four people to sit - since people do throw parties in this manner. The Talmud goes through multiple calculations to explain the twenty-four count.
