 On the road Avishai saw Orpah, the mother of Yishbi. She tried to kill him with a spindle, but he killed her instead. Seeing Avishai approach, Yishbi threw David up and prepared a spear to catch him. Avishai said the name of God, and David hung in the air. Avishai then asked David, what he was doing there, and David explained that he chose the punishment for himself. Avishai advised him to leave the punishment for his descendants, and to save himself from the trouble now. Avishai then said another name of God, David came down, and the two started running away. Yishbi kept pursuing them, until they told him, "Look at your mother in the grave," after which they killed him.
