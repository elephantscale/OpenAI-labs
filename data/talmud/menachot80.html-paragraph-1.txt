 Similarly, if one says "let this animal be a substitute for this thanksgiving offering," he has done something that is not right - for substitutes are prohibited - but his words take effect, and now both animals are thanksgiving offerings; however, the second one is brought without the breads. This rule is also true when his thanksgiving offering was lost, he designated another one instead, and then the first one was found.
