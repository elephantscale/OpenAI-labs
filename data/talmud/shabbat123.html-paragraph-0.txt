Shabbat 123 - Carriages, trunks and movable closets House construction and repairs are considered building and are forbidden to be performed on Shabbat. Therefore, a door of a house, once detached, cannot be reattached to it. Moreover, it cannot even be moved on Shabbat, since it has no use by itself, and it considered "muktzeh," something not prepared for use on Shabbat.
