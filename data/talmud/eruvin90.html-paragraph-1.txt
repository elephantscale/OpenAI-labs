 Take, for example, a ship. Rav says that on Shabbat one can carry throughout the entire ship, and Shmuel says that he is allowed to carry objects for only four steps. What is each one's logic? Rav considers the ship a private area because it is surrounded by the ship's walls, which make it into a closed partition. However, Shmuel claims that these walls are not made to surround the ship on the sides, but rather to keep the water outside, so they don't count.
