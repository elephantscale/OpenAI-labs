Avodah Zarah 3 - A Second Chance in Torah for the Nations In the future, the Holy One Blessed Be He will bring a Torah scroll, place it in His bosom and declare, "Whoever occupied himself with it shall come and take his reward." All the nations will come in disarray and demand a reward. God will tell them to come back in order, and the first one will be the Roman empire.
