Niddah 73 - Where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel Agree We have seen a disagreement between the two schools concerning the last, eleventh day, of a woman's niddah/zavah cycle, where Beit Shammai were consistently strict and gave the eleventh day the same stringencies as the previous ten days, but Beit Hillel's rulings were mixed. The two schools agree, however, on the laws of the previous ten days.
