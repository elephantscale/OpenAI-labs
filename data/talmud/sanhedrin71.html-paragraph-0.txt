Sanhedrin 71 - Exclusions from the Law of Wayward and Rebellious Son To become a "wayward and rebellious son," the boy must steal money, spend it on meat and wine, and then consume the requisite amounts of these things. If he stole from his father and ate in his father's domain, or if he stole from others and ate in the domain of others - he does not qualify as a wayward and rebellious son, unless he steals from his father and eats in the domain of others. Rabbi Yose says, not until he steals from both his father and from his mother.
