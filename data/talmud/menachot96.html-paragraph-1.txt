 The two loaves on Shavuot were seven hand-breadths long and four hand-breadths wide. They had strips of dough at the corners, or "horns," that were four finger-breadths long. The breads of visions were larger: ten hand-breadths long, five hand-breadths wide, and their "horns" were seven finger-breadths in length.
