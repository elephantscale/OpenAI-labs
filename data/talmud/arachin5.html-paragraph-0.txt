Arachin 5 - Personal Valuation of an Infant and of an Idolater When the Torah assigned symbolic values of people to be donated to the Temple, it started from one month old. What happens when one promises to donate the symbolic value of a child before one month? Rabbi Meir says that people never make vain statements in serious matters, therefore, since he knows that there is no value assigned to the baby, he means to donate its value in the slave market. The Sages say that people do make vain statements, and thus this person is treated as one who said nothing.
