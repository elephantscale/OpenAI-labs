Chullin 101 - The Sciatic Sinew of a Non-Kosher Animal The prohibition of a sciatic sinew applies to a kosher animal, but it does not apply to a non-kosher one. What difference does it make, if a non-kosher animal is anyway forbidden to be eaten? One is transgressing a different prohibition when eating it - the prohibition of a non-kosher animal, and not the one of a sciatic sinew. That is important for giving him a proper warning, that is, telling him exactly what prohibition he transgresses, moments before he eats it, as a prerequisite for lashes.
