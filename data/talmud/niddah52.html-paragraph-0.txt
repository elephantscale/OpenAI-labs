Niddah 52 - Two Hairs We already mentioned that a sign of physical maturity and becoming legally adult, for a bat- and bar-mitzvah are two hairs. There are multiple opinions on where these hairs must be, but the accepted view is that they must be in the pubic area. At this time, the girl can perform the ritual of yibum or halitzah, and the boy becomes eligible for the punishment of a rebellious son. He stops being punishable as a rebellious son when his beard grows around. This really means the bottom (pubic) beard, and only a first ring of hair there, but the Sages employed a euphemism.
