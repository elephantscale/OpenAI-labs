 Among the sin-offerings, only the sin-offering of a metzorah (spiritual leper) and his guilt-offering require libations. How do I know that? The Torah stated, "the three-tenths of fine flour for a flour offering," - and this is talking about an animal sacrifice of a metzorah. But perhaps he should bring a flour offering by itself? - Since the Torah later says "the kohen shall offer the burned offering and flour," this leads me to understand that the Torah is speaking about the flour that comes with the animal offering.
