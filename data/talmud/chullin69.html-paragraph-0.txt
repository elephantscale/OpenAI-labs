Chullin 69 - Can a Limb be Born? Rav said that once a fetus puts forth its foreleg, then even if it draws it back, the limb becomes prohibited. However, Rabbi Yochanan disagrees. What is the root of their disagreement? Rav says that once the limb is out of its mother's womb, it is considered to have been born. If the complete fetus is subsequently born, then its shechitah will permit the limb to be eaten. But if its mother is slaughtered, then the fetus is permitted, but the limb is forever forbidden.
