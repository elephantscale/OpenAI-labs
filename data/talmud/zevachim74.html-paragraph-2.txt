 The ruling of Rav is completely at odds with our previous ruling that one forbidden sacrifice is not nullified even in ten thousand permitted sacrifices. Since the sacrifices are consigned to die, we should just wait till the first one dies, then say that this one that died was the prohibited one, and bring the rest! The answer: Rav's "ring" opinion follows only Rabbi Eliezer, but the majority of Sages do not agree to it.
