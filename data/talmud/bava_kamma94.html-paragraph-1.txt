 This enactment was promulgated by the court of Rabbi Yehudah The Prince, to make it easier to repent for those who want to do it. It applies only to long-term transgressors, who can't return all money. Still, they need to try to return the money, to fulfill their Biblical obligation. It is a disagreement whether this enactment applies nowadays.
