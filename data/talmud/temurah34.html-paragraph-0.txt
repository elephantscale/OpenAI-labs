Temurah 34 - What Is Buried, And What Is Burned The following items are buried, because they are, for one reason or another, forbidden for benefit: the aborted fetus of a sacrifice or its afterbirth - because one cannot use them; an ox that killed a human and was executed by stoning - because its meat is prohibited for benefit; the shorn hair of a nazirite, and meat cooked with milk - because these, too, are forbidden for benefit.
