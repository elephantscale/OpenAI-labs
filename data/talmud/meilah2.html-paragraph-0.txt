Meilah 2 - What Constitutes Misappropriation Misappropriation (Meilah) is committed when someone uses Temple property for his own benefit. If that property is designated exclusively as "holies of God," such as a burned offering, which is burned on the Altar completely, or if it is an object or money of the Temple Treasury, and he derived benefit in the amount of at least one prutah (the smallest coin), then he committed misappropriation. He needs to pay the value of the benefit, add one-fifth, and bring a guilt-offering.
