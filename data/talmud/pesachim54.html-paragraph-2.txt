 If one wants to behave like a Sage on Tisha B'Av, abstaining from work, this is permissible, and there is no haughtiness there - so says Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And indeed, if an onlooker sees him idle on that day, he will not necessarily conclude that the person is trying to assume the honor due to a Sage. Rather, he will think to himself, "He just does not have work. See how many idlers are out there in the street."
