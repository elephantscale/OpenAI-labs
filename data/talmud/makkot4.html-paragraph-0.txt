Makkot 4 - The Basic Case of Plotting Witnesses If two witnesses said, "We testify about this person that he owes his fellow two hundred zuz", and they are found to be false plotting witnesses, they receive lashes for false testimony, and they pay their victim the amount they intended to make him lose, since lashes and repayment come from different places in the Torah - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The Sages, however, say that whoever pays does not receive lashes, since a person cannot be liable to both lashes and monetary payment for the same crime.
