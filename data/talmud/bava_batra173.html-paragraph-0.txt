Bava Batra 173 - Obligations of a Loan Guarantor If a man says to his son on his deathbed, "One document among my several loan documents has been paid, but I don't know which one it is" - all the loan documents are treated as paid, since each borrower can claim that it is his debt that is paid. If two loan documents were from a single borrower, the larger one is considered paid.
