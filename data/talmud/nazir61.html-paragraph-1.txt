 All three rules above are not obvious. Why is it that a non-Jew cannot become a nazir? - Because the Torah said, "Speak to the sons of Israel," but not to other peoples. However, this cannot serve as proof because later, the Torah uses the term "man," which should mean "any man." In fact, a non-Jew can bring sacrifices in the Temple, so why can't he be a nazir?
