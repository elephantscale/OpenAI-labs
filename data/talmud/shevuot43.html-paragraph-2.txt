 Who swears as to the value of the collateral? The one in whose possession it was lost, or the lender. If the borrower were to swear and not be careful in assessing the value, and the lender would later produce the deposit, the borrower would be disqualified from taking oaths and from testifying in court. This would be unfair, so the Sages shifted the oath to the lender.
