 What is the source of this rule? - We can learn it from Hannah , who was "exceptionally bitter at heart." (Book of Samuel)? - No, that cannot be the source, perhaps Hannah had more problems than normal. Rather it is from the psalm: "As for me... I will prostrate myself in awe of You." - No, that can't be the source either, maybe King David is trying to be exceptionally righteous. Rather, it is from here, "Serve God with awe and rejoice with trepidation."
