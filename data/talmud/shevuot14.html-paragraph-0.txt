Shevuot 14 - Awareness of Impurity - Two That Are Really Four If a person touched an object that made him impure, forgot about it, and then knowingly ate sacrifices, he has to bring a "variable" offering that depends on his means. This case is explicitly mentioned in the Torah. However, if he remembered about his impurity but forgot that the food he was eating was holy, he is equally liable, only this case in not mentioned in the Torah but is rather derived.
