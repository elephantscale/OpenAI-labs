Niddah 34 - Purity of Idolaters By Torah law, idolaters do not have the strict ritual impurity of the Jews. However, in order to distance Jewish children from the children of idolaters, the Sages decreed to treat all idolaters and idolatresses as ritually impure because of zivah, as we have seen before. This was not, however, a real impurity, and if holy foods came in contact with such decreed impurity, they could not be burned - since in general it is forbidden to destroy sacrificial foods.
