Arachin 30 - Redemption of Ancestral Fields If the hereditary owner of an ancestral fields sold it to the first buyer for a hundred coins (zuz), and the first buyer then sold it to the second for two hundred coins, then when the original owner comes to redeem the field, he calculates the redemption fee only according to the hundred coins he paid the first buyer, since the Torah said, "And he shall calculate the years of his sale and return the remainder to the man to whom he sold it."
