 One must mentioned the covenant of circumcision and of the Land, as well as the Kingdom of the House of David. Rav Zeira once said to Rav Chisda, "Come, master, and let us study the Talmud." However, Rav Chisda replied, "I have not learned how to properly say the after-meal prayer, and I should study the Talmud?" Rav Zeira asked, "Why is this?" and Rav Chisda explained: "I was at the table of the Exilarch, and I recited the after-meal prayer, and did not mention the three covenants, and I saw Rav Sheshet straighten his neck like a snake, as if to attack me."
