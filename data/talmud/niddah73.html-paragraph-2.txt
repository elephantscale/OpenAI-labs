 What is the actual source for the zavah laws in the Torah? - The phrase "When a woman has a discharge of blood, she is ritually impure (niddah) for seven days" - teaches after the seven days she cannot be a nidah, only a zavah. But maybe a discharge during the day renders her a niddah, and at night - a zavah? No, that's cannot be, since the Torah said, "After her niddah period."
