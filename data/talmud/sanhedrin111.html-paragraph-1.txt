 Isaiah said, "Therefore Sheol (another name for Gehinnom) has expanded her desire and opened wide her mouth without measure." Resh Lakish explained "without measure" as saying that whoever leaves even a single law unfulfilled is condemned to punishment in Gehinnom. Rabbi Yochanan said to him, "God, the Master, is not pleased with you saying such things about his subjects." Rather, if one learned no more than a single law, he will be spared the punishment of Sheol.
