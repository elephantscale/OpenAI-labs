Gittin 72 - Conditional Divorce If a husband told his wife, "This is your Get if I die," or, "This is your Get if I die from this illness," or "This is your Get after my death," he has not said anything. In all three cases, the Get is void because the husband stipulated that it will take effect after his death and this is impossible.
