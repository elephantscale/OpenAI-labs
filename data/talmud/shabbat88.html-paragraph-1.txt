 When the Jews promised first to "do" and after to "hear what to do," God asked, "Who revealed to them the secret of the angels, who also fulfill My word, and then listen to My voice?" To illustrate, Rava was once studying the Talmud without noticing that his foot was stomping on his fingers so that they were bleeding. A certain Sadducee told him, "You were impulsive you and you are still that way! You promised to observe the Torah, and only later found it what it was, and you are still studying the Talmud like this. How do you know there is something there?" Rava answered, "We trust God as one who would out of love, not like you, whose distrust will be your undoing." About us it says "You have captured My heart, My sister, O bride!"
