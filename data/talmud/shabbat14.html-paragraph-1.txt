 One whose head and body enters drawn water (such as tap water or water brought in a pail) becomes ritually impure. That sounds upside-down: water makes impure. However, the reason for this is that people who did not have a proper clean mikveh to purify themselves used to immerse in a dirty stale water, naturally assembled in caves. While being a ritually valid mikveh, it would make one physically dirty, and he would then take a shower. Eventually, people starting thinking that the shower has the power to ritually purify a person, which was not true. There, if one cannot use the shower without loosing the effect of his prior immersion in a mikveh, this practice stops and the confusion is eliminated.
