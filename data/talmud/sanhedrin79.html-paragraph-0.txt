Sanhedrin 79 - Aiming at One, but Killing Another If one intended to kill an animal but killed a man instead, he is not liable, since he lacked the intent to kill a man. If one intended to kill an idolater but killed a Jew instead, he cannot be executed by a Jewish court. While it is certainly forbidden to kill any human being, this matter is outside of the jurisdiction of Sanhedrin. If one intended to kill a premature, nonviable baby, but killed a viable one instead, he is not liable to execution, because the warning given to him would have been uncertain.
