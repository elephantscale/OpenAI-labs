 How much of a sela coin can be missing? Rabbi Meir says, four issars per sela, or 1/24. Rabbi Yehuda says, 1/12, and Rabbi Shimon says eight pundions, or 1/6. For how long can one return a defective coin? In large cities, as long as it takes to show the coin to a moneychanger; in villages, until the following Sabbath, when the person will use it shopping for food.
