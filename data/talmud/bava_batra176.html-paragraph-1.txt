 Ben Nannas, however, says that in this case the lender cannot collect from the guarantor at all. Said Rabbi Ishmael to him, "Why?" Explains Ben Nannas: If a creditor was strangling someone in the street, and this fellow encountered them and said to the creditor, "Leave him be, and I will give you the money that he owes" - the guarantor is not liable, because the lender did not lend the money trusting the guarantor in the first place.
