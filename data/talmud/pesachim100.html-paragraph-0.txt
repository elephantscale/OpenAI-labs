Pesachim 100 - Continue the meal Normally, one should emphasize the beginning of Shabbat or Holiday by not eating before the evening meal - to get the full enjoyment of it. But what if one started a meal much earlier, and it extended up to the evening meal time, and the Shabbat or Holiday has started? - One covers the meal with a cloth and recites the Kiddush. Then he continues the meal, but now it is also in honor of Shabbat.
