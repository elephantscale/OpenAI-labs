 When his close relative dies, the king does not join the funeral procession. When they feed him the mourner's meal, all the people recline on the floor, and the king sits on a chair of distinction. He may lead his army to fight a discretionary war, with the consent of the Sanhedrin. He may break the fences to make path for himself.
