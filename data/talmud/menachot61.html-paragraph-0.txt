Menachot 61 - Waving but not Bringing Near Some offerings, and not only flour offerings, require waving, for example, the oil (about half-liter) of a metzora (a spiritual leper), and his lamb brought as a guilt-offering. Before a metzora was purified, he had to bring these, and they were "waved as a wave service to God." According to Rabbi Eliezer ban Yakov, the first fruit were also waved before they were given to a kohen to eat.
