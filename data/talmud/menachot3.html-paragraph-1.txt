 Throughout the Talmud, Rabbi Shimon analyzes the reasons for the Torah commandments. Based on this analysis, he re-interprets the laws. For example, the law here is that the wrong intention should invalidate the flour offering. However, logic dictates that if from the offering itself it is clear what type it is, then the wrong intent should not matter - and that is how Rabbi Shimon rules.
