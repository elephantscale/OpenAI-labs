 The walls surrounding the Temple Mount had five gateways, each with its own name and function. The Temple Courtyard, too, was enclosed by walls on all four sides, and there were seven major gateways that led to the Courtyard. The Hall of Fire - where, as we have described, slept the Kohanim during the night - had four chambers that opened into it, like suites that open into a ballroom. Two of them were in the consecrated portion - The Chamber of Sacrificial Lambs, and the Chamber of the Vision Bread, and two in the unconsecrated part - in one they hid the pieces of the Altar defiled by idol worship, and the other one led to the Immersion Room.
