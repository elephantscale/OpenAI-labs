Sanhedrin 77 - No Liability for Indirect Killing Someone bound his fellow by the seashore, then caused a stream of water to sweep over him, and thereby killed him. This was done thus - he made a hole in a dam that stood between the water and the victim, so that the water would gush out and drown the victim. In such a case, the water is considered like arrows that he shot at the victim, and he is liable to execution.
