 For example, if one sells a house to his fellow and says to him, "I am selling you this house with the stipulation that the fenced rooftop is mine" - the fenced rooftop is his. The clause "rooftop is mine" is redundant. It is already his, as we have learned before. Therefore, this clause is reinterpreted to give him additional rights.
