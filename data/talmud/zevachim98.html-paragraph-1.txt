 Basically, every kohen is entitled to a share from every sacrifice. However, practically it would be inconvenient for everyone to come to the Temple when they pleased, so Moses diveded them into eight groups, and later Shmuel and David expanded this to twenty four groups, or families. Therefore, each kohen would have to serve in the Temple for one week in six months, and during this week he was entitled to a share from sacrifices.
