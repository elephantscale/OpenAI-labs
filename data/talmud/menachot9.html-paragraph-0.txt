Menachot 9 - If Enemies Laid Siege to the Courtyard If enemies have surrounded the Courtyard of the Temple and are shooting into it, so that the Kohanim cannot eat sacrifices in the Courtyard, they are allowed to enter the Temple Hall and to continue eating the meat of the most holy offerings, as well as cooked flour-offerings, inside. How do we know that? The Torah says "in the most holy you shall eat it" Most holy here means the Sanctuary, of the Temple Hall.
