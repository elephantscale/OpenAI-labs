Yoma 12 - Another High Priest While the High Priest spent his seven days in solitude preparing for Yom Kippur, another Kohen was designated as standby for the contingency that the High Priest would become disqualified for services. This could be due to a seminal emission on the night of Yom Kippur or to some other ritual impurity. In that case, the designated Kohen would become a High Priest and perform the service.
