Shabbat 18 - Vessels working on Shabbat When one makes ink by pouring water onto dye, this must be done sufficiently early before Shabbat, so that the ink becomes completely soaked before sundown - these are the words of Beit Shammai, but Beit Hillel permit it. In the same way, when putting bundles of flax into an oven to be bleached by the heat, one must give it sufficient time for bundles to become heated while it is yet day - again, these are the words of Beit Shammai, and Beit Hillel allow it.
