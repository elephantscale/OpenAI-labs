Makkot 12 - Life in the City of Refuge If a tree stands inside a city of refuge, but its branches lean outside, and the killer is clinging to the trunk, the redeemer of the blood may still kill him, because we consider only the branches. Rav Ashi says, "Also the branches" - which changes the ruling to say just the opposite: the killer is protected if the tree is inside and he is under the leaves outside.
