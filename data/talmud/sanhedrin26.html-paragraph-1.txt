 Once during Shmita Resh Lakish joined Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Shimon, to observe the procedure of calculating a leap year. He saw a man plowing and said "This man is a Kohen and he is plowing." (Kohanim were especially suspect). They answered, "He might say that he is just a worker." He then saw a man pruning and said "Kohen is pruning." They answered, "He may say that he needs the branches."
