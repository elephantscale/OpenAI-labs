 What about an heir? Does he acquire the "do not delay" obligation from his parent to bring a sacrifice designated by his father? On the one hand, the Torah said "when you promise," and the heir did not make a promise. On the other hand, it also said, "you will bring," and perhaps this does include the heir. Rabbi Chiya offered an answer: "God will require it from you," - which means to tell us, "from you, but not from your heir." The heir thus does not acquire the parent's obligation.
