 The attendant of the court binds his hands on either side of the post, grasps his garments and pulls them away from the area to be lashed, and if they tear, they tear. A stone is placed behind the one being lashed, and the attendant stands on it with the strap in his hand. The whip is made of two calfskin straps with additional straps of donkey hide; the whip's handle is one hand-breadth, and the length of it is such that its tip should reach the beginning of the stomach when he is lashed across his back.
