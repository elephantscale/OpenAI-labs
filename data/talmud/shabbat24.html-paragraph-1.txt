 Rav Huna gave a series of omens. One who is habitual to light Shabbat and Hanukkah candles will merit children who are Torah scholars, (based on "mitzvah is lamp and Torah is light"). One who is careful with the mezuzah will merit a beautiful residence. One who is careful about tzitzit will merit a beautiful garment. One who is careful to say the Shabbat Kiddush on wine will merit to fill many kegs of wine.
