Shabbat 121 - Firemen If a non-Jew comes to extinguish a fire that broke out in a Jew's home on Shabbat, the Jew should not tell him to stop extinguishing, but he also should not tell him not to - because the Jew has not responsibility to watch that a non-Jew does not work on Shabbat. However, if a Jewish minor wants to extinguish the fire, the Jew should stop him, since it is the Jew's responsibility to have minors rest on Shabbat.
