 The purpose of this oath was often to verify that the wife has not yet collected her Ketubah and that she is coming with a valid claim on the total amount. However, there was a strong incentive for the widow to take this oath, even if she had already collected some or all of the payment. She rationalized that she was entitled to extra compensation because of the care she would have to give to the orphans. The courts stopped accepting this oath, and widows had no way of collecting the Ketubah. To rectify that, the Sages gave the orphans the right to ask her to pronounce a vow (such as "The use of my husband's property is prohibited to me if I embezzled"), and then she gets the Ketubah.
