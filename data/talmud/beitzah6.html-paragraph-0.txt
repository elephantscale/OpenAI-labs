Beitzah 6 - A chick Having discussed an egg laid on a Holiday (Yom Tov), the Talmud turns to a chick hatched on a Holiday. What is its status? Can it be eaten? We have two opinions. One is that it is muktzeh (set aside) - since before it hatched, it was not fit for any use. The other opinion is that it is permitted: if one were to slaughter it, it would become permitted as food - and this permission removes the prohibition of muktzeh.
