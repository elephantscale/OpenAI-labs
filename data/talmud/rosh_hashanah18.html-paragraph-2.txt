 In fact, so many miraculous salvations happened in the days of the Second Temple that the Sages had to write down a scroll enumerating these minor festivals when fasting and eulogizing the dead were not allowed. It was called "The Scroll of Fasts." Later, with the destruction of the Second Temple, these minor festivals were also canceled. Some say that they stayed since they were not related to the Temple. All agree that the amount of trouble and suffering magnified in the subsequent generations, and people became numb to them. Hence, they did not appreciate the deliverance from them either.
