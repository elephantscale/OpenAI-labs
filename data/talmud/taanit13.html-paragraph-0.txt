Taanit 13 - Series of fasts If the first three fasts were not answered by rain, the Court decrees three more fasts. People stop eating before sunset; all other restrictions are similar to Yom Kippur or Tisha B'Av, and even work is not allowed. If these fasts pass and still there is no rain, the Court decrees another seven fasts. On these last fasts, even stores are closed.
