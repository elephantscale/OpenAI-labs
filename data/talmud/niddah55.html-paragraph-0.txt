Niddah 55 - Substances Some substances convey ritual impurity while they are moist, but not after they dry up. These include the emission of a zav (a special white discharge from a male member), his phlegm and saliva, creepy crawly animals (such as rats), an animal carcass, and human semen. Others, however, convey impurity both while moist and also when dry, and this includes the blood of a niddah, and the flesh of a corpse.
