Pesachim 109 - More wine Everybody should drink wine at the Seder: men, women, and children, because Exodus's miracle happened to all. However, not everybody enjoys wine. It is also important for everyone to be joyful on a Holiday, and therefore man gladden their hearts with wine, women - with new dresses, and children are given roasted nuts and sweets. The nosh serves to keep the children awake at the Seder since "tell you son and daughter" is an important part of the Seder. As an illustration, Rabbi Akiva never liked to say, "Let's all stand up and leave the study hall," except for two occasions: on the eve of Passover when one needs to make the kids have an afternoon nap, to stay awake at the Seder, and before Yom Kippur - since it is a mitzvah to eat then.
