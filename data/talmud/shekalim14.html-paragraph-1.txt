 Mordechai was one of the members of the High Court or the Sanhedrin. All judges in the Sanhedrin had to know 70 languages to understand the witnesses directly, not through an interpreter. Still, at least two judges needed to be able to also speak the languages. If they had four such judges, it was called an outstanding Sanhedrin. We should mention here that Shekalim is part of the Jerusalem Talmud. Babylonian Talmud has a more lenient opinion - that all judges together needed to know the majority of languages.
