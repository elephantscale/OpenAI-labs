 What does it matter what the reason is if the messenger has to say these words, "written and signed in front of me" anyway? - For example, if two messengers came. The reason Rava - that they can't find two witnesses would not apply any longer, so they don't need to make the statement. But the logic of Rabbah - that they may not write the document specifically for her - would still apply, and accordingly they would have to talk about how it was written and signed.
