Shabbat 108 - Writing on fish skin Rav Huna said, "One can write tefillin on the skin of a kosher bird." Rav asked asked, "What is Rav Huna teaching us? That bird skins qualify as hides? - We know that! One who bruises a bird on Shabbat is liable, and that can only be because birds have hides, under which the blood collects." His student Abaye told him, "Actually, Rav Huna is teaching us a lot. Since birds skins are perforated with weathers, we might have thought that this makes them invalid for writing a tefillin, and he teaches us otherwise."
