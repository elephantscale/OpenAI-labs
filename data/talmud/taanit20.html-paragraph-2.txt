 Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, was going home from his yeshiva on a donkey, and he was happy about the Torah that he had learned. A hideous man greeted him, but he replied, "How ugly is that man!" The man said, "Go back to the craftsman who made me and complain to him." Rabbi Elazar immediately got down from the donkey and started begging forgiveness, but the man was adamant. Only when the people of the town to which they were going interceded did the man grant forgiveness. Rabbi Elazar directed to the study hall, and his first lesson was, "A person should be pliable as a reed and not hard as a cedar."
