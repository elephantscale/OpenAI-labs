Eruvin 58 - The act of measuring The techum distance that limits walking on Shabbat should be measured only with a rope fifty-amah (about 100 feet) long, no more and no less. Both surveyors must hold their end of the rope next to the heart. If one, for example, would measure next to the heart and the other next to the head, they would be shortchanging the eruv.
