Bechorot 15 - If a Consecrated Animal Became Blemished If an animal was consecrated, but afterwards developed a blemish and was redeemed, it never completely goes back to its previous state: it is exempt from the laws of firstborn, and one does not have to give gifts from it to a kohen, that is, foreleg, jaws, and abomasum. Why is this? The Torah said about a redeemed sacrifice, "You can eat it, like a deer or an ibex." The extra word "deer" teaches us that it is not subject to the laws of firstborn, just as a deer is not subject to them, and the extra word "ibex" - that the kohen's gifts need not be given - just as they need not be given from an ibex.
