 What is fit for the kohanim is unfit for the Leviim, and vice versa. The kohanim were disqualified by blemishes, but they could serve at any age. In contrast, the Leviim were not disqualified by blemishes, but they had age limitations: they would start studies at 25 and continue on to service at 30. They retired at 50.
