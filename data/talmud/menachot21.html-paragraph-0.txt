Menachot 21 - Wooden Blocks are Also Sacrifices According to Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, one can bring wood blocks as a standalone sacrifice. The minimum in this case would be two blocks, and their dimensions are one by one cubit. Since it is a sacrifice, it requires two more blocks of wood to burn it, like any other sacrifice.
