 The father of (future) Rabbi Chanina pronounced his son Chanina a nazir, and they took the boy to Rabban Gamliel to examine if he was still a child. But Chanina said, "Please do not trouble yourself. If I am still a minor, I do what my father says. And if I am a grownup, then I declare myself a nazir."
