 Various phrases in the psalms were actually said by different people and in different circumstances. King David later combined them together into one whole. For example, here: "I thank You, for You have answered me" was said by King David; "The stones that builders despised has become the cornerstone" was said by David's father Ishai, and "This emanates from God" was said by David's brothers.
