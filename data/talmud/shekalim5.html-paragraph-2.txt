 If, after being thought missing, the coins were found, then both the first and the second collection have acquired the designation of "half-shekel" and cannot be taken back; moreover, the extra coins cannot be used for the next year either, because they were designated for this year. What do they do? They put them in another collection box, called "Old shekalim." These monies were used not for sacrifices but for the betterment of the city of Jerusalem.
