Avodah Zarah 48 - Houses of Idol Worship If one's house adjoined a building of idol worship and their common wall collapsed, it is forbidden to rebuild it. What should he do? He withdraws four steps into his property and builds the wall there, but to prevent the idol from benefit, he uses his area as a toilet or plants it with thorn-bushes.
