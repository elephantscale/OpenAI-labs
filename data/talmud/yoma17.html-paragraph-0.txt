Yoma 17 - The right-of-way for the High Priest On all the days of the year other than Yom Kippur, the High Priest does not do the regular daily Temple duties - unless he wants to. In that case, he has the right to say, "I will offer this burnt offering," or "I will offer this flour offering," or "I will eat this sin-offering," and so on.
