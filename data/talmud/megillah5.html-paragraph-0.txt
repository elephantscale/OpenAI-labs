Megillah 5 - What is a large town? We mentioned that people living in villages can read the Megillah a day or two before Purim, but those who live in larger towns cannot advance the reading, and should do it in its proper time. What is considered a large town? - A place that has "ten idlers." Some say, these are people supported by the community who study in the synagogue at all times, and others - that they don't have to be supported, as long as they are available for prayer.
