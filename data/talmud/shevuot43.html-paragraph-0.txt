Shevuot 43 - Lender is Responsible for Collateral If one lends his fellow money on collateral, he is considered a paid guardian of this collateral. Therefore, should the collateral be lost or stolen, the lender is liable for it. If the collateral was worth more than the loan, the lender must pay the balance to the borrower, and if it was worth less than the loan, the borrower pays the balance to the lender.
