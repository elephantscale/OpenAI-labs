 For example, if one slaughtered an animal and its offspring, both regular animals, outside the Temple, and both are now fit for consumption, then for the second slaughter he is liable like for any other negative commandment of the Torah. However, if both the parent and the offspring were sacrifices and he slaughtered both outside the Temple Courtyard, then for the first slaughter he is liable because he did it outside the Temple, and may be cut off from the people, but the second animal is now unfit for slaughter on the same day, and thus the slaughterer is not liable for slaughtering it outside. He is liable for "it and its offspring" slaughter though.
