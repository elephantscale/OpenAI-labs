Beitzah 15 - Does one have to eat on a Holiday? If the Holiday (Yom Tov) is followed by Shabbat, then people celebrating the Yom Tov may completely forget about Shabbat and finish all the provisions and drinks coming to Shabbat with nothing to eat. So that this should not happen, the Sages instituted a reminder in the form of "food mix" or "eruvei tavshilin." This food eruv is prepared before the Yom Tov, by taking some foods in one's hand and declaring "with this eruv (which I will eat on Shabbat) it becomes permitted to me to cook on a Yom Tov for the needs of Shabbat." Normally cooking on a Yom Tov for Shabbat is forbidden, but with this eruv, this, too, becomes allowed.
