Pesachim 103 - Havdallah At the end of Shabbat or Holiday, one says the blessing called Havdalah, which means "The One who made a distinction between holy and weekday." Other blessings are recited together with Havdalah, and there are also many opinions on their order. The opinion of Rava prevails here, and it is abbreviated as YKNH"Z, which stands for blessings on the wine, Kiddush, light (which was not lit on Shabbat), Havdalah, and Shehecheyanu, "Who allowed us to live to this season."
