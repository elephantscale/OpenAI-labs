Ketubot 27 - A siege If a city was besieged and captured by an army, all women living there who are wives of Kohanim are presumed to have been violated and must leave their husbands. However, if there is a hiding place in the city, then each woman can be presumed to have been hiding there, and thus all women are permitted to remain with their husbands. Also, if she has any one witness, this suffices.
