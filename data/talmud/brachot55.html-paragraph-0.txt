Brachot 55 - An uninterpreted dream is like an unread letter Three things prolong the days and years of a person: spending long time in prayer, at the table, and in a toilet. But we learned that one who prays long comes away with a broken heart!? - That is if he depends on his merit to have his prayer answered, however, if he only asks for mercy, it is good. Why at a table? - Because, if a poor comes along, he can feed him. Why a toilet? - Because it is good for one's health.
