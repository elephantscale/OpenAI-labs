Chullin 99 - Why One-In-Sixty and not the Majority? The Torah said, "You should follow the majority." Accordingly, any substance should be nullified in a majority, that is, if a forbidden piece became confused with two or more permitted pieces, and you cannot tell which piece is which, then the forbidden piece becomes nullified, and all three pieces are permitted. Why did we say then that a forbidden foreleg becomes nullified in the proportion of one-in-sixty, and according to some, even one-in-hundred?
