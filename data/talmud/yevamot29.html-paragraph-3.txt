 However, Beit Hillel says that the statement only looks like a betrothal, but being that it is not a real one, but only an action instituted by the Sages for propriety, she is not his legal wife. Therefore, he cannot keep her - because there is another sister with whom he is connected with the bond of yibum, nor can he marry that sister because of the same bond, plus his additional statement; in both cases, he is as if marrying his wife's sister, which is forbidden. Therefore, he must do a chalitzah with the first sister and give her a divorce document (Get) because of his prior statement. He then needs to do chalitzah with the other sister. He is thus left without any wife through no fault of his own.
