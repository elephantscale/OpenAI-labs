 What is the source for these laws and what is the logic of the argument? The Torah said, "If his sin becomes known to him." This means that he himself became aware of his act. Alternatively, others told him, but he was silent, thus confirming that he accepted the fact and became aware of it. Thus, if he denies one witness, he is believed.
