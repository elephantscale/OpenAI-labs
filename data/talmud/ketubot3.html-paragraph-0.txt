Ketubot 3 - A parent dies before the wedding Earlier, we mentioned that if the groom delays the wedding, the obligation to support his wife already devolves on him - unless it is delayed due to an unforeseen circumstance. By contrast, with divorces (Get), we do not pay attention to any unforeseen circumstances. For example, there was a case where the husband gave his wife a Get on the condition that he did not come back within a year. On the last day, he was coming but was delayed by the river. Even though he cried from the other side of it, "See, I came back!" - the divorce had already taken place. Why did the Sages establish this rule? - To help modest women, who would be still waiting for their husbands, saying that perhaps he did not fulfill the condition of the divorce due to an unforeseen circumstance; and also to stop the immodest ones who would get married by saying that the husband gave her a valid divorce, when in fact we were prevented from returning.
