 We implied that it is the man's obligation to procreate. Why? The Torah said, "Be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth and conquer it," talking to men who, in general, engage in battles and conquer. Another opinion is that both men and women have this mitzvah because the word "Be fruitful (p'ru)" is plural imperative. What does the first one answer? The term "conquer" is missing a letter "u" in the way it is written and can be read in the singular.
