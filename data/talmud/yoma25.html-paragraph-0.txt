Yoma 25 - What garments to wear for the lottery? In total, there were four lotteries every day to dole out the Temple services. Why were lots used for that? - What kind of question is this, for we already said it was to avoid discord!? - Actually, the meaning of the question is why assemble four times when one lot for all services could be sufficient? - It is good to stir up the Courtyard, for the greater the number of people serving God - the better.
