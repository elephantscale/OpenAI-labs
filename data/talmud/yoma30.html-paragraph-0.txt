Yoma 30 - Cleanliness in the Temple When a priest in the Temple urinated, he needed to clean his hands and feet for service by washing them. If he moved his bowels, he needed a complete immersion in a mikveh. In general, anybody who entered the Temple needed to go to the Mikveh first, even if he knew he was ritually pure.
