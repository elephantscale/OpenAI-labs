 Rabbi Yehoshua answered that he heard a similar law: "If one eats from one offering in five different dishes, he brings five sacrifices for misappropriation of Temple property," and that in Rabbi Akiva's case, which is even worse, since it is five different animals, he for sure needs five sacrifices to atone. However, Rabbi Akiva replied, "If your teachers taught you this, I will accept, because they may have had their reasons, but if it your own logic, I will refute it: in your case, he is receiving pleasure from eating, and that's why he has to bring a sin-offering for each mistake, but in my case he does not receive any pleasure, and perhaps one sacrifice will atone for all."
