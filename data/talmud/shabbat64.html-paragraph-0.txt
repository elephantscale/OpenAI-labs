Shabbat 64 - Ornaments of a woman on Shabbat A woman may go out on Shabbat with her hair braided with strands of other hair, whether the strands are of her own hair, of her companion, or of an animal. All parts of this ruling are necessary. Otherwise we might have thought that her own hair is acceptable because she is used to it, but not that of her companion. Or we might think that human hair would blend into hers, whereas the animal's would not, and she might then take it off and carry - so the ruling tells us that there is no such concern.
