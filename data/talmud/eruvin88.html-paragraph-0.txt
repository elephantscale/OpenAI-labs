Eruvin 88 - Balcony over water If a balcony protrudes over a body of water, this water is neither a public area (people don't walk there), nor a private one (it is not surrounded by fences). The Sages called such area a "karmelit" and prohibited carrying from it to the private domain on Shabbat. Therefore, one cannot draw water to his balcony. To permit this, he must create a fence, a partition either above or below the balcony. The walls of the partition will be considered as if going down to the water level, making this part of the water into his private area, where carrying is permitted.
