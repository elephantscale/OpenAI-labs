Eruvin 36 - Running away from a tax collector When tax collecting was farmed out, and the collectors were, in fact, extortionists, it was common to avoid confrontations with them. If one fears a visit from a tax collector on Shabbat, he may increase the two thousand step limit that he is allowed to walk, to four thousand, in the following way. He can place two portions of eruv food in two places, one two thousand steps to the east and another - to the west. He can then make a stipulation, saying that if the tax collector comes tomorrow from the east, his west eruv takes effect, and if he comes from the west, then his east eruv is activated. If the collectors come from both directions, he will decide where to go, and his direction will determine the eruv, and if they don't come at all, neither of his eruvs are active, and he stays where he resides.
