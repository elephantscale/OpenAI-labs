 How did Rav do it, seeing that one should not ask for forgiveness more than three times? - Rav went beyond the letter of the law. And how could Rabbi Chanina not forgive? We know that if one overlooks an insult and does not insist on his rights, then the Heavenly court overlooks his mistakes and the fact that he himself is unworthy? - Rabbi Chanina had a special reason: in a dream, he saw Rav hanging from a palm tree, and he knew that this meant that Rav was destined to become the head of the academy. This meant that he, Rabbi Chanina, who was the head of the academy in Israel, would have to die to vacate the post. Therefore, he pushed Rav to go to Babylonia, where Rav finally established his great academy, which existed for eight hundred years.
