 If one had in front of him a whole loaf of bread and slices of better quality, which is preferable for saying a blessing? Rabbi Yochanan says that it is the whole one, and Rav Huna - that it is a better quality slice. Although the law in this follows Rabbi Yochanan, if one can eat from both and make peace between Rabbi Yochanan and Rav Huna - so much the better.
