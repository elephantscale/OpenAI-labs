 Hides of regular offerings, such as a peace offering, belong to their owners. Hides of all most holy offerings other than the burnt offering also belong to the kohanim, and this is derived through logic: if in the case of a burnt offering, where the kohanim do not eat the meat, the hide nevertheless goes to them, then for a sin offering, where the kohanim do eat the meat, certainly the hide goes to them.
