 Rabbi Shimon gives a new rule which changes our understanding of the laws of eruv so far: all roofs - and even all courtyards - combine together into one area, and one can carry there - talking about objects which started Shabbat in a courtyard but not in a house. Thus, if an object was in a house at the beginning of Shabbat, the laws and limitations of eruv apply to it. But if it was in a courtyard, then one can take it to another courtyard even without an eruv.
