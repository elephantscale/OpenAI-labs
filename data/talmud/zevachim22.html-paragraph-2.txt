 Any Temple vessel could also be used for sanctifying the Kohen's hands and feet, but a regular non-sacrificial vessel could not. Why? Let's try to prove this by comparison with the copper base, in which the Kiyor stood. Since this base could not be used for washing the Kohen's hands and feet, even though it was a Temple vessel, isn't it true that a regular vessel surely could not be used? - No! The base is not made for storing water at all! Rather, this is derived from the word that the Torah used - "from it" - and not from other vessels!
