Bava Batra 17 - God Blessed Abraham with Everything Rabbi Meir: "If Abraham had a daughter, he would not want her to marry in Canaan, and he would not want her to go away, for everywhere they served idols. He did not have a daughter, and in his case it was a blessing." Rabbi Yehudah: "He did have a daughter, and her name was 'Everything' (bakol)."
