Temurah 4 - Transgression Without An Action As a rule, one can be punished only for actions, not speech or thoughts. There are exceptions to this rule, sacrifice exchange being one of them. Rabbi Yose son of Rabbi Chanina adds one more: one who first separates the kohen's portion, and afterwards the first fruit from his crop, as the Torah said, "Your first fruit and the kohen's portion don't delay." Since the kohen's portion can be designated in thought alone, one is liable to lashes for a thought.
