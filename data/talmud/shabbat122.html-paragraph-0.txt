Shabbat 122 - One light serves a hundred people If a gentile lit a lamp for himself on Shabbat, a Jew may use its light. However, if he lit it for the sake of a Jew, one may not use it. Why? Firstly, a Jew should not instruct a gentile to do forbidden Shabbat work. Secondly, a Jew is not allowed to benefit from Shabbat violation. In fact, even after Shabbat he should wait for as long as it would take to perform the work in question, and only then use the result.
