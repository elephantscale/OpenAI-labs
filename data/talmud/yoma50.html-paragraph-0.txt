Yoma 50 - High Priest dies If the High Priest confessed his errors, then slaughtered the bull over which he confessed but then died, can a substitute High Priest enter the Holy of Holies with the blood of this bull? When the Torah said, "With this Aaron entersâ€¦ with a bull," - did it mean to include (with the bull or even with its blood), or to exclude (with the bull but not with its blood)? Rav Ashi suggested the following answer: "Does Aaron really enter dragging the bull by the horns!? - Of course not! Rather, he brings in the blood. Thus, the substitute High Priest can also bring the blood." And Rav Ami, who disagreed, what is his logic? - He says, "With this Aaron is ready to come into the Holy of Holies" - that is, with the bull which he slaughters, not with its blood.
