Avodah Zarah 17 - Repentance of Elazar ben Durdia When Ulla would return from the study hall, he would kiss his sisters on their arms, and some say, on their chests, and some say - on the garment opposite that part of the body. Ulla was confident that since he was pure of character, he would not entertain improper thought, but did it out of respect. He advised others to refrain from such activities. Some say, it is an allegory of Ulla's love of Torah.
