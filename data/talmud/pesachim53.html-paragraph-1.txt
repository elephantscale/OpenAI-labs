 Some communities adopted a prohibition not to sell small livestock - so that one does not come to sell large livestock. Others say that the prohibition was added to prevent bestiality. However, this is a kind of custom that was not generally adopted, and one is not obligated to conform to it, even in a city where everyone else does so.
