Arachin 28 - Promise to the Temple is Like Deed with People If bidders offered respectively ten, twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty shekels for a field consecrated to the Temple, and then one who has bid fifty retracted, he is still responsible to add his ten shekels to the forty-shekel bid. If afterwards the one who has bid forty retracted, they pay ten shekels each. However, if they retracted simultaneously, the one who has bid fifty is responsible for his ten, and for half of the other one's ten, so he pays fifteen, while the other one pays five.
