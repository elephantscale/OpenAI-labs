Shevuot 27 - An Oath to Violate a Mitzvah If one swears to violate a mitzvah but does not violate it - he is not liable for an oath of utterance and a sacrifice. In the same way, if he swears to fulfill a mitzvah and does not do it, he is exempt. Oaths only apply to something that he has the freedom to do or not to do and not to mitzvot, which one is obligated to do from the time of Mount Sinai. However, in the first case, he is liable to lashes for making a vain oath.
