Makkot 23 - The Positive Value of Lashes If one who is liable to excision (karet) is lashed, he become exempt from his excision, following the verse in the Torah, "and your brother will be demeaned before your eyes" - after he has been lashed, he is again like your brother - these are the words of Rabbi Chananyah ben Gamliel.
