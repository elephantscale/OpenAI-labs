Nedarim 89 - A vow of a widow The Torah said, "A vow of a widow shall stand." But this is obvious, for who could potentially annul a vow of an independent woman? So why are these words necessary? - This teaches the following case: if she took a vow while being a widow - for example, if she said that she would have something prohibited to her after thirty days - and then she got married. Such a vow the new husband will not be able to annul.
