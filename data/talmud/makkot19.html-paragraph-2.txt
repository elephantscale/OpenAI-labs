 This argument, however, has an internal weakness: firstborn requires that its blood be placed on the Altar, which is a stringency that the second tithe does not have. Then how do we know not to bring the second tithe today? Only from the verse, "In the place where He will choose to rest His name - there you will eat second tithe and the firstborn animals." Since they are placed next to each other in the same verse, they have the same law.
