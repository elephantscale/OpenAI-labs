Temurah 5 - You May Not or You Can Not When the Torah said about something "You shall not," did it mean "you may not," but your act takes effect, or did it mean "you cannot," and if you do it, it's ineffective anyway? The "you may not" is represented by Abaye, and "you can not" - by Rava. According to Abaye, if one violates a law, he is punished with lashes, because his act was effective. But according to Rava, why is he punished, if he achieved nothing? - Simply because he violated the statement of the Merciful One.
