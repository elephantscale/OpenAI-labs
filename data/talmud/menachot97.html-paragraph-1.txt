 There were four props of gold on the table and twenty-eight rods, each like half a hollow reed, to separate the breads from one another, in order that they would not become moldy. This is based on the phrase in the Torah, "For [the table] make bread forms,incense bowls, and side frames, as well as the half tubes that will serve as dividers [between the loaves of bread]. All these shall be made of pure gold."
