Niddah 48 - A Minor That Never Grows Up In some rare cases a male or a female never completely matures. This changes some marital laws for them, thus, if a female is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, she must bring a proof of her age, and will then be considered as forever immature ("aylonit"): yibum (levirate marriage) cannot be done to her, and she does not require halitzah and can marry anyone if her husband dies. Similarly, a man who is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, must bring a proof of his age, and he then need not perform yibum or be the subject of halitzah.
