Bava Metzia 11 - Acquisition with the Help of a Field If one saw people running after a find, after a lame deer, or after young pigeons that cannot yet fly, and said, "My field has acquired it for me," - it has indeed acquired it for him. If the deer was running normally, or if the pigeons were flying, and he said, "My field has acquired it for me," - he has said nothing.
