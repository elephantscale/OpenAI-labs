Pesachim 35 - What to make matzah from? One can make matzah only from wheat, barley, spelt, rye, and oats. Why just these? - Because the Torah said, "With the Passover offering, you don't eat any leavenâ€¦ for seven days you will eat matzah." Thus, only things that can become leaven can serve for matzah for the Passover Seder. What is excluded? For example, rice.
