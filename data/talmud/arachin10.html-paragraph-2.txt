 Flutes numbered no less than two and no more than twelve. Flutes were played whenever praise (Hallel) was sung. They were not made from copper but from reeds, or bamboo, because of sweeter sound. At music's ending, only one flute played, and some say, flutes alone played, because it makes a pleasant ending.
