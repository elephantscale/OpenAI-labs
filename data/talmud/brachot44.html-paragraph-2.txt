 Rabbah bar bar Chanah related that when Rabbi Yochanan and his students went there, they took a hundred baskets with ten fruit each, Rabbi Yochanan would eat of all them and swear that he was as hungry as if he never ate. Rabbi Abahu ate the fruit of Genosar until a fly would slip off his forehead. Rav Ami and Rav Assi would eat until their hair would fall out. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would eat until he became delirious, and Rabbi Yochanan would notify the Exilarch who would send a troop of men to bring him home.
