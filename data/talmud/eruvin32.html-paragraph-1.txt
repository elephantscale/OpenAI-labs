 If he still needs to go further, he can change his dwelling place. For that, on Friday he can walk up to two thousand amot in the direction that he will have to go on Shabbat, and place food ("eruv") there. This place then becomes his new "dwelling," and he has to stay in the new circle. We thus find that he can go from his home to the new place, but not in the opposite direction, because this is where his new circle ends.
