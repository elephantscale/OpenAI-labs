Arachin 22 - Debt Collections and Court Auctions If one dies without paying his debts, the court may have to sell his lands. If he leaves young orphans, the court first appraises the field, then conducts an auction, allowing people to bid on it for thirty days. For a field consecrated to the Temple, the auction lasts for sixty days. During these days there is a public auction announcement in the morning and in the evening.
