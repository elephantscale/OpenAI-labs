Shabbat 130 - Preparing for a circumcision Circumcision should be done on the eighth day of a baby's life, and it can be done even on Shabbat - because the Torah required it to be done in its proper time. If one forgot to bring a circumcision knife before Shabbat, then normally, since carrying anything in a public area is prohibited, he cannot bring this knife now. Bringing the knife is not a mitzvah per se, but only a preparation for it.
