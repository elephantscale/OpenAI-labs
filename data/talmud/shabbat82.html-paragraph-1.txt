 For example, there are a few cases in the Torah where one who carries an item indirectly, without touching it, nevertheless becomes ritually impure, such as meat of a non-kosher animal or a kosher one that was killed but not by slaughter. How do we know that the Sages applied the same law to one who carries an idol? - Explains Rabbi Akiva, since Isaiah says that in the future the Jews will "Cast the idols away as other objects that engender impurity, and you will say to them - Go!" - therefore we know that the Sages established ritual impurity for one who carries an idol.
