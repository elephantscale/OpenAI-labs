 Who can bring the Get if the husband can't come? Basically anyone, but here the deranged person and the deaf-mute are excluded, because they would have to testify that they saw the Get being written and signed. The Talmud goes into complications of someone who was under bar-mitzvah age when accepted the Get and started the journey, but then grew up, or someone who was normal, became deranged on the way, and then possibly became lucid again.
