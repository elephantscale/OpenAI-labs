Chullin 88 - Materials for Covering the Animal Blood If blood from animal slaughter became mixed with water and the amount of water is such that the mixture still looks like blood, one has to cover it. If blood mixed with red wine, then we look at wine as if it were water. If the corresponding amount of water in the mixture would not make it loose its appearance of blood, one still has to cover it. The same is true if it mixed with some other blood that does not require covering, such as blood of a domestic animal, but Rabbi Yehudah argues and says that blood cannot nullify other blood, and one always has to cover the mixture.
