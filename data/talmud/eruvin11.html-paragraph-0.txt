Eruvin 11 - Shape of a door A shape of a door is constructed of two side posts and a bar or a rope across the top. Although it does not have practical utility, it helps for many laws. For example, an alley with an entrance wider than ten amot (20 feet) cannot be adjusted with a crossbeam on top of it, but the shape of a door here helps to permit carrying on Shabbat in such an alley. It also helps if the doors of the alley are too high for the crossbeam to be noticed.
