 If you see an evil person with luck on his side - "do not contend with this wicked man." However, Rabbi Shimon taught just the opposite, that it is permissible to contend with the wicked in this world, following "Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but the righteous will fight them." In fact, if someone whispers in your ear the verse of Rabbi Yitzhak about not contending - that is your spirit weakened by your errors, but what it really means - do not try to be like them.
