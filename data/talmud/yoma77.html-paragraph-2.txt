 Even though washing is forbidden, if one wants to visit his father or his teacher on Yom Kippur, and a river separates them, he can cross even if the water reaches his neck. He is even allowed to go back since otherwise, he will refrain from going in the future. Only washing for pleasure is actually forbidden.
