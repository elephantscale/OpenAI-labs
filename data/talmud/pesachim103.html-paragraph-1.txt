 Three people were drinking wine at a meal: Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi. They differed in saying blessings over wine, but each one explained his behavior. Ameimar said a blessing in each cup. He would decide to stop drinking after each cup but would every time change his mind. So, a new blessing was in order. Mar Zutra said the blessing on the first cup and on the last cup, which would come after the Grace after Meal. The new wine that came after the Grace, according to Mar Zutra, required a new blessing. Rav Ashi only said the blessing on the first cup. All wine after that was a continuation of drinking.
