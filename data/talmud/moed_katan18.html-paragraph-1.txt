 Since the seven days of holidays are comparable to the seven days of mourning, would the same disagreement exist about a mourner cutting his nails? Shmuel believed it does not apply on the holiday weekday or during mourning. It happened that Rav Pinchas was in mourning and did not cut his nails. Shmuel came to console him and asked why he behaved this way. Rav Pinchas retorted, "And if happened to you, would you cut them?" These words indeed came to pass, and Shmuel lost a close relative. When Rav Pinchas visited him, Shmuel threw his nails at him in anger.
