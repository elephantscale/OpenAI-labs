 If one says to his fellow, "Sell me this yoke for 200 zuz," then it is obvious that the yoke alone is not sold for this amount, and thus the oxen are included. But the Sages say, "The purchase price is no proof." It may be viewed as gratuity that the buyer gives to the seller, or the overpayment, in which case the sale would be voidable.
