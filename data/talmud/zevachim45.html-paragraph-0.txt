Zevachim 45 - Non-Jewish Sacrifices in the Temple Non-Jews too can bring sacrifices in the Temple. More specifically, they can consecrate voluntary offerings or offerings in fulfillment of a personal vow, and bring them to the Temple for sacrifice. This is the derived from the verse "Any man (even an idolater) who will bring his offering for any of their vows, or their voluntary offerings to God for a burn offering..." It is a matter of dispute (which will be discussed 148 days from now) whether they can consecrate only a burnt offering are any voluntary offering, such as peace- or thanksgiving-offering.
