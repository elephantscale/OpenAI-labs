Zevachim 104 - Hides of Invalidated Offerings If an offering became invalidated prior to being skinned, its hide does not go to the kohanim. Only if the offering was skinned before it became invalidated, then the kohanim get the hide. Rabbi Chanina, the long-time administrator of the kohanim says, "In all the days of my life I never saw an invalidated hide being burned" - meaning that the invalidation discussed above never happened. But the Sages say that "I never saw" is not a proof.
