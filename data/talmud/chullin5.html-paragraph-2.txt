 Then who is considered non-observant? Those who deny the complete Torah, that is, those who pour libations to idols and those who violate Shabbat in public. With this, Rav Anan's proof is refuted, and only people who observe Shabbat but violate some commandments, such as eating non-kosher meat, are allowed to do shechitah.
