Sanhedrin 5 - Permission to Judge Although three judges are required for monetary cases, if the judge is a widely recognized expert who has successfully tried many cases without error, he may adjudicate these cases even alone. If, in addition, he has received authorization to judge from a government authority (The Babylonian Exilarch in the time of the Talmud) then the judge is free from liability if he rules erroneously.
