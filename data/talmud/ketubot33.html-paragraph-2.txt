 Comparing death with torture, Rav said, "Even though Chananya, Mishael, and Azaryah were ready to give up their lives but not bow down to an idol, had they whipped them, they would bow." We thus see that when choosing a punishment, the court must consider whiplashes stricter than death. However, Rav Samma, the son of Rav Ashi, said to his father, "That is not the same! The court gives a fixed number of lashes, but the torture continues!" Others read this statement of Rav completely the opposite, as a question: "Even if they tortured them, would they bow down to an idol? -- Surely not!" Under this reading, idol worshiping would be permitted when faced with torture, but Chananya and his friends went beyond the letter of the law.
