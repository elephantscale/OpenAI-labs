 If one's hand is resting in the airspace of a latrine, can he say the Shema then? Rav Huna says that he is permitted, relying on the verse in the psalms, "All that breathe shall praise God" - that is, only the position of his nose and mouth matters. However Rav Chisda forbids it, based on a different verse, "All my limbs shall exclaim, 'God, who is like You!'"
