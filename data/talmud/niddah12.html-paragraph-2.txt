 Rav Kahana wanted to know if that was indeed the law. He asked the wives of two Sages, Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, "Do your husbands require you to make an examination, after they come home on Fridays after a week of teaching in the study hall?" and they answered, "No." Why didn't he ask the husbands themselves? - Because they would tell him the actual law, but not the personal stringency, if they had one, while the wives would not be so careful about keeping the private stringency secret."
