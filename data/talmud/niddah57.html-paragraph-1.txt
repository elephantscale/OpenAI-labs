 If she finds it on her tunic, then if it is from the belt down - she is ritually impure, and from the belt up - she is pure. If it is on the sleeve, and that sleeve reaches opposite the genitals - she is ritually impure, if not, she is pure. If she is accustomed to take off her tunic and cover herself with it at night when sleeping, then no matter where the stain is found, she would be ritually impure, because the tunic moves around during the night (unless she tied it to her head).
