Zevachim 99 - Which Kohen Does Not Get a Share in the Offerings A person whose close relative has died gets the legal status of a mourner (onein) for that day. A kohen who is a mourner is allowed to touch sacrifices - he does not make them ritually impure - but he cannot offer them, and he does not have a claim to a share to eat that night.
