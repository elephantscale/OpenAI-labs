 Rava says that an extra lobe in the lungs makes an animal a terefah. Rav Acha was sitting in front of Mereimar's house when a butcher brought a case of an extra lobe for examination. Mereimar declared it kosher. Rav Acha said to the butcher, "Go ask Mereimar again." Mereimar said to the butcher, "Tell the one sitting in front of my house that the law is not like Rava."
