Shabbat 107 - Two people catch a deer If a deer was inside the house, and a person sat in the doorway without completely blocking it, so that the deer can get out, that person is not liable for trapping the deer on Shabbat. However, if a second person sat in that door and made the exit completely blocked, the second one is liable. The first one is not, because he did nothing.
