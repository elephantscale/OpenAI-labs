Meilah 14 - A Bird Nest Atop A Tree A bird nest atop a tree consecrated to the Temple should not be used, by the decree of the Sages, but there is not prohibition of misappropriation. Even if we assume that it was built from the twigs that grew after consecration, they may be prohibited, but not with the serious misappropriation laws. If that nest was on top of a tree planted for worship, he should knock it down with a stick, then take it.
