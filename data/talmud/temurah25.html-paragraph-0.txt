Temurah 25 - Consecrating A Pregnant Animal If one consecrates a pregnant animal as a sacrifice and says, "The fetus of this animal is designated as a burned offering, and she herself a peace offering," then his declaration takes effect. Since he consecrated the fetus first, his subsequent declaration applies to mother only.
