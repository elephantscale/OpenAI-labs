Avodah Zarah 62 - Loophole for Working with Libation Wine If an idol worshipper hires a Jewish worker to do work for him in handling libation wine, either to pour it into barrels or to transport the barrels, the worker's wage is prohibited for benefit. However, if he hired the worker to do other work for him, then even if he said to him, "Transport this barrel of libation wine from one place to another," the worker's wage is permitted.
