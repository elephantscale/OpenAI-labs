 When the Temple was destroyed, God found Abraham standing there and asked "What is my beloved doing in my Temple?" Abraham said, "I have come concerning my children." God said, "You children sinned and were therefore exiled." Abraham said "Perhaps they sinned inadvertently?" God answered, "She carries out her deliberate schemes." Abraham said, "Perhaps only a minority of them sinned." God said, "The majority." Abraham said "You should have remembered the covenant of circumcision." God replied, "They violated it and rejoiced." Abraham put his hands on his head and wept, "Maybe, Heaven forbid, there is no remedy for them?" The Heavenly voice responded to him, "Just as an olive tree, its destiny is fulfilled at its end, so the Children of Israel, their destiny is fulfilled at their end."
