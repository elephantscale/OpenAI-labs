Shabbat 106 - Traps Earlier we learned that for doing destructive acts on Shabbat one is not liable. However, Rabbi Shimon finds two exceptions to this: wounding a person or burning something. Here one is liable for Shabbat violation. Why? After all, Rabbi Shimon is the one who permits unintended violations, such as dragging a bench on the ground, even though he may dig a ditch! Rabbi Shimon will tell you that since the Torah had to allow circumcision on Shabbat, this shows us that normally making a wound is prohibited. Then what about our previous learning that ALL destructive acts are not a Torah violation? - That is the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. And what is the basis for it? He said that circumcision is a constructive act of rectifying the child.
