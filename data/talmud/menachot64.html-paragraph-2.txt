 The special question would come up on Shabbat. The barley could still be harvested, since the Torah required this offering, even on Shabbat, but the question was whether they should minimize the Shabbat violation. Rabbi Ishmael says that on Shabbat they would harvest enough barley only for an ephah, but on weekday - much more, to produce the best final quality of flour. However, the Sages say that they used the same amount on Shabbat and on weekdays.
