 If an object used in Temple service became defective, it was never repaired, but completely replaced instead, because of the rule that "there is no place for poverty in the place of opulence." Thus, punctured vessels were completely molted down and made into new vessels, but not patched, and the vestments of the kohanim were only washed from slight dirt, where water alone would be sufficient (and then using soap was allowed), but otherwise they were replaced.
