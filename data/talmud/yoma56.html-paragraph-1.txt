 But why does Rabbi Yehudah insist that there was only one stand? Let them make two, and put reminder notes on them, "Bull" and "Goat!" - That is because according to Rabbi Yehudah, people ignore reminder notes, so it would not help. - That could not be, because Rabbi Yehudah agrees that there were thirteen collection chests in the Temple, each marked with its appropriate name, like "New shekalim," "bird offerings," etc. He only disagrees about one chest, "Obligatory offerings," about which he says it did not exist, and instead, this money was collected manually. But why not? Even if that money is accidentally mixed in, let us take out 4 coins and say, "These coins are retroactively designated as the original mixed in coins." To that, I will answer that Rabbi Yehudah does not agree to the retroactive designation, also called "bereirah."
