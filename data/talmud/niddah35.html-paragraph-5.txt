 The next eleven days after that are potential "zivah" days. Any discharge during these days renders her a "zavah." If the discharge lasted for one or two days, she is called "minor zavah" and needs only to wait for another day free of discharge, and can go to a mikveh. However, three days of discharge render her a "major zavah." She needs to observe seven clean days, immerse in a mikveh, and in the time of the Temple bring an offering. After that, the new cycle begins, where the next discharge will render her a niddah.
