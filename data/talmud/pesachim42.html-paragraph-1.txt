 Rav Nachman explained: originally, wine from Judea would not sour, due to the merit of its being used in the Temple, and to convert it to vinegar, one had to add barley. The standard vinegar of that time was the one made from Judean wine. However, now it is the wine of Edom (Roman empire and its successors) that does not sour, so they have to add barley to it, and it is called "Idumean vinegar."
