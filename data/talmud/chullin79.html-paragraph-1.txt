 The Sages compare the situation to that of a mother bird hovering over her young in the nest, where the mother bird is mentioned specifically and must be sent away. Chananyah says that you can't compare the two: sending away the mother bird does not apply to a nest that you own, whereas "it and its offspring" applies even to stray animals that are not yours.
