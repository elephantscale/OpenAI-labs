 What if he disregarded the prohibition and cooked anyway? Can this be eaten? The Talmud tries to derive the answer from various similar rulings. For example, we know that one can cook for himself for Yom Tov, and if some food is left over for Shabbat - that is fine. However, he should not use this device as a loophole. Can we assume that when he deliberately violates the prohibition of an eruv, it is worse than a loophole and is indeed prohibited? - No, we cannot. Perhaps the Sages were stricter with loopholes than with deliberate violations. On so on, two more attempts, but the question remains unresolved.
