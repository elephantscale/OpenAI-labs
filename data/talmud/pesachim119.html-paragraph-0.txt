Pesachim 119 - From the psalms What does "To the leader - a psalm of David" mean? "Leader," or "menatzeach" in Hebrew means "One who enables others to conquer him," signifies that God is actually happy when others conquer Him. In that, He is not like people. When God wanted to destroy the Jewish people, Moses stopped Him, and God reacted by saying, "had not Moses, my chosen one, stood in the breach."
