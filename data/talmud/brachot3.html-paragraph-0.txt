Brachot 3 - Night Watches Rabbi Eliezer told us that the "Shema" may be said only during the first third of the night or "the first watch." Why did he use this expression? He wanted to tell us that there are "watches in heaven" and "watches on earth," that is, there are spiritual changes during the night, reflected in propitious prayer and study times. At each and every watch, the Holy One Blessed Be He sits and roars like a lion, as Jeremiah has said, "God will roar from on high... He will roar and roar over his lodging."
