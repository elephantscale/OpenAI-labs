Zevachim 55 - Guilt-, Thanksgiving-, and Peace-Offerings The remaining most holy offerings are the two lambs brought on Shavuot, and the guilt offerings, which are brought for the following: theft (when one swears falsely that he does not owe the money); misappropriation and personal use of Temple property; relations with a slave woman designated for another man - even if done on purpose and not by mistake; guilt-offerings of a Nazir and a Metsora; and a "pending" offering, brought when one might have transgressed but is not sure.
