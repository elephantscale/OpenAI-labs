 Furthermore, it is good to know the names or qualities of specific demons to write protective amulets. Here is a story to illustrate. A sorb tree may be inhabited by no less than sixty demons of the "shedei" variety. Once a watchman stood by such tree, the demons entered his body, and he was in danger. A certain Sage who did not know about sorb tree wrote an amulet that mentioned only one demon. He heard demons dance inside the tree, singing, "Although this young Torah scholar wears a turban, he does not even know how to say a blessing over it" (incidentally, the blessing is "â€¦ who adorns Israel with beauty."). They meant that he is not worthy of his garment. Another Sage overheard this and wrote an amulet for sixty demons. Afterward, he heard them saying, "Remove your belongings from here!"
