Brachot 56 - Dreams follow the interpretation Rav Bana'ah said, "There were twenty-four interpreters of dreams in Jerusalem. Once I had a dream and went to each one for the interpretation. Each one interpreted it in a different way, and all these interpretations were realized for me, following the principle stated in the Torah that 'all dreams follow the mouth', that is, the import of a dream depends upon the interpretation given to it." But is there such phrase in the Torah? - Indeed, yes, in the story of Joseph, where is says, "Just as he interpreted it for us, so did it happen."
