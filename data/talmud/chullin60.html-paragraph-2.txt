 Rav Assi asked a question: "The earth brought forth vegetation on Tuesday, but the plants were not there on Friday. That's a contradiction!" He answered, "All vegetation remained underground until Adam prayed for it." Rav Nachman bar Pappa had a garden. He planted seeds there, but they did not grow. He prayed, the rain came, and they grew. He said, "That is the teaching of Rav Assi!"
