Rav Dimi, a Sage, brought his figs to a town which wanted to give him exclusive trading rights. They sent Rav Adda bar Abba to test him. He asked, "If an elephant swallows a willow-reed basket and then ejects it through its rectum, is it susceptible to ritual impurity or is it like manure? Rav Dimi didn't know, so Rav Adda patronized him. Rav Dimi's figs spoiled, and Rav Adda died. Every Sage involved took the blame for Rav Adda's death on himself - because they wanted to discharge their karmic debt.
