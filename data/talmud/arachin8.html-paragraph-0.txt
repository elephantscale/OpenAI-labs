Arachin 8 - Minimum and Maximum Amounts for Personal Valuations One who vowed to give his own or someone else's symbolic value to the Temple pays according to the schedule given by the Torah, but if he is poor, a Kohen can reduce his payment. However, it is never less than a selah (shekel), since the Torah said, "And every valuation shall be in a sacred shekel." Incidentally, it cannot exceed 50 shekels, the upper limit given by the Torah.
