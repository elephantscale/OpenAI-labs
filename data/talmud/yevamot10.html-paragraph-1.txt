 Let us say one's mother was legally married to his father (a standard case), but after his father's death, she "married" his brother (from another woman). The "marriage" of his mother and his brother never took legal effect because she was previously married to the brother's father. Therefore, if his brother now dies, there isn't even a suggestion that he should marry his mother in yibum.
