 Ulla and Rav Chisda were walking along the road, and Rav Chisda uttered a sigh. Ulla asked him, "Don't you agree that a sigh breaks the body of a person?" Rav Chisda answered, "This is the house of Rav Chana, where sixty cooks were preparing meals for poor at all times, which had four entrances for all to enter, and with Rav Chana never taking his hand out of his purse, not to embarrass a poor by making him wait even a second - and it is now ruined!" Ulla answered, "The Temple is in ruins, and it is enough for a slave to be like the master" - and Rav Chisda was consoled.
