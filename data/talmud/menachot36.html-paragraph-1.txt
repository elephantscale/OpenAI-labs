 The latest time to wear tefillin is when the sun sets. Rabbi Yakov says that one may leave the tefillin on until people have stopped walking the streets and no one can longer see him any longer. The Sages say that he may wear it until the time he decides to go to sleep. There a few possibilities to explain this argument: that the Torah prohibited wearing tefillin after sunset, that the Sages prohibited this out of concern for people falling asleep in their tefillin, or that no such prohibitions exist.
