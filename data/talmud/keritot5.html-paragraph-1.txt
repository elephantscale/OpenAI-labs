 Moses made the anointing oil by boiling cinnamon roots in a "hin" of olive oil, then adding spices. Other say that the roots were soaked in water, to preserve the oil. Regardless of the order, all agree that multiple miracles happened with this oil. The amount of oil was only twelve lugin (between one and two gallons), and it sufficed to anoint the Tabernacle, all of its vessels, Aaron and his sons, all the high priests and kings after that, and it still remains intact for the future.
