 Rabbi Yehudah found a verse which he expounded. In regard to the carcass of a kosher species of bird the Torah says "died by itself or was torn by wild animals". Why is the word "torn" mentioned at all? If a torn animal can survive for a year, then it does not transmit impurity until it actually dies. And if it cannot survive a year, then it is already like dead, and this is the case of "died by itself," and it imparts impurity. Either way, we already know the answer.
