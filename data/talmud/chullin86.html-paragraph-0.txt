Chullin 86 - Shechitah by a Deaf-mute, Deranged, or Minor Rabbi Chiya's flax was attacked by moths, and Rabbi Yehudah the Prince told him to kill a bird in a way which would make it a terefah; the moths will smell the blood and abandon the flax. Why not kill it outright? - That would also work, but even making it a terefah would allow him not to cover its blood.
