 Some people have legitimate access to other people's property, so they can never establish chazakah, even if they have the movables in their possession, or if they occupy the real property. Thus, craftsmen, sharecroppers, and property administrators cannot establish a chazakah. So too a husband cannot establish a chazakah in his wife's property, nor can a wife establish a chazakah in her husband property, nor a father in his son's property, nor a son in his father's property.
