 If one left his wall hanging and not reaching the ground, this is OK, provided that they are within the three handbreadths from the ground and small goats cannot enter his sukkah. In fact, if his sukkah is only 10 handbreadths high, he can use such a hanging wall that is only slightly more than four handbreadths, right in mid-air. If it is closer than three handbreadths to both the floor and the ceiling, we apply the principle of "connect" ("lavud") and consider the missing three handbreadths both above and below as if they were present.
