 Rav Safra's father died and left money to Rav Safra and his minor brothers. Rav Safra did business with this money and realized profit. The brothers summoned him for adjudication before Rava, but Rava said, "Rav Safra is a Sage and a scholar. He would not stop his studies to work for others, so it is assumed that he worked for himself."
