Sanhedrin 107 - King David and Bathsheba David wanted to be mentioned in one breath with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God told him, "I tested them, but you I did not test." David said, "Test me!" God told him, "I will, and I will even tell you what the test will be - women." David then increased relations with his wife, and he forgot that it only increases desire.
