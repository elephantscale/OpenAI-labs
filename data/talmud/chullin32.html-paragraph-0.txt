Chullin 32 - Pause During Shechitah If while one was doing the shechitah the knife fell from his hand, and then he picked it up and completed the shechitah, it is valid - if the pause was no longer than what it takes to make a shechitah. The same applies to a case where he had to sharpen the knife, or where he grew weak while doing the shechitah, and his companion finished it for him. Rabbi Shimon says, the pause should not be longer than what it takes to examine the knife.
