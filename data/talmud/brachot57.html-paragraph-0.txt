Brachot 57 - Symbols in dream interpretation Bar Kappara said to Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, "In my dream I saw that my nose had fallen off." Rabbi Yehudah explained, "Anger ('haron af,' literally, 'the burning of the nose') had been directed at you, but it has been removed." He further said, "I saw my two hands being cut off." Rabbi Yehudah replied, "You won't need the labor of your hands." He then said, "I saw my legs cut off," and Rabbi Yehudah told him, "You will ride on a horse," that is, achieve prominence.
