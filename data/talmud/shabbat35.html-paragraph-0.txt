Shabbat 35 - Twilight Twilight on Friday afternoon might be still Friday, a weekday, or it might be Shabbat. At this time, one should not separate the tithes from his produce. Ordinarily, one is allowed snacks before he separates tithes, but not a complete sit-down meal. However, on Shabbat even snacks have a feeling of restful unhurried meals, and thus untithed produce cannot be eaten at all. Even though tithing is not really work, it is prohibited by the Sages because it is too similar to a repair: the food was not allowed to be eaten, and now - it is! Neither should one dip his dishes in a mikveh to purify them at this time - again, because it is similar to repairing them.
