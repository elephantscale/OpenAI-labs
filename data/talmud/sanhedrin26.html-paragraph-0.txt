Sanhedrin 26 - Seventh-year (Shmita) Merchants One is allowed to gather produce of the seventh year (Shmita), but not trade in it. Initially both Shmita gatherers and traders were disqualified from serving as witnesses. However, when the ruling power began to collect tax in the seventh year, Rabbi Yannai allowed to plant on Shmita, since Shmita today is only a decree of the Sages. After this only merchants remained disqualified.
