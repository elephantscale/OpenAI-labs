 Continuing the list of items that an animal may not wear in a public area on Shabbat - because it would be carrying these items for the needs of its owner - chicken may not go out with cords or straps on its legs. A cow may not go with a hedgehog skin around its udder (made as protection against rodents), nor can it have a strap between its horns. The cow of Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah used to go out with a strap between her horns, and it was against the will of the Sages.
