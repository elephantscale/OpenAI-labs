    "# M4 Agentic AI - Adding a component-level eval to the research workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous graded lab (M3), you built a tool-using research agent that carried out a workflow of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search the web for information.  \n",
    "2. Reflect on its output.  \n",
    "3. Publish a clear HTML report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in this ungraded lab, you are going to focus on evaluating **one component of that workflow**: the *research step*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating essays and refining them, here you will design a **component-level evaluation** to check the quality of sources returned by the research step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation will compare the URLs retrieved by the agent against a **predefined list of preferred domains** (e.g., `arxiv.org`, `nature.com`, `nasa.gov`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to quantify whether the system is pulling information from trustworthy sources, using an **objective, per-example ground truth evaluation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Lab overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Andrew showed a case where web search results were of **poor quality**, making it difficult to trust the information retrieved.  \n",
    "Building on that example, in this lab you will evaluate the reliability of sources by comparing them against a **predefined list of preferred domains**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this evaluation, we’ll focus on the topic *“recent developments in black hole science”*, one of the examples highlighted in the course.  \n",
    "The idea is to verify whether the web search tool is returning sources from preferred domains, and to quantify the ratio of preferred vs. total results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation will be implemented as a single function that performs an **objective, per-example check**. It will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse the Tavily output (our web search tool).  \n",
    "* Identify which URLs belong to the list of **preferred domains**.  \n",
    "* Compute the ratio of preferred vs. total retrieved sources.  \n",
    "* Return both a boolean flag (**PASS/FAIL**) and a Markdown-formatted summary that can be embedded directly into reports.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"M4-UGL-1.png\" width=\"70%\">  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function that can check the search results of a web search API for **preferred sources**.  \n",
    "* Create an evaluation to verify if your sources come from your **preferred domains**.  \n",
    "* Add a **component-level evaluation** to the web search function.  \n"

    "Here, we split the web search functionality into a separate function called `find_references`. This allows you to evaluate the search results independently of the writing and reflection steps, which we will leave out from this lab since we are only focusing on the output of the web search step.\n",

    "\n",
    "The role of `find_references` is to **gather external information** from tools such as **Arxiv**, **Tavily**, and **Wikipedia**.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Not all sources retrieved by web search are equally reliable.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This is an example of an **objective evaluation with a clear per-example ground truth**.  \n",

    "<img src='M4-UGL-1-Evaluations.png' width='80%'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why component-level evaluations?\n",
    "\n",
    "As Andrew mentioned in the lecture:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the problem lies in web search (usually the **first step** in a graded lab workflow), rerunning the *entire* pipeline (search → draft → reflect) every time can be **expensive** and noisy.  \n",
    "- Small improvements in web search quality may be hidden by randomness introduced by later components.  \n",
    "- By evaluating the web search *alone*, you get a **clearer signal** of whether that component is improving.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Component-level evals are also efficient when multiple teams are working on different pieces of a system: each team can optimize its own component using a clear metric, without needing to run or wait for full end-to-end tests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we evaluate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation here is **objective**, and so can be evaluated using code. It has an example-specific ground truth - the list of preferred sources for this black hole query. To build the eval, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the URLs returned by Tavily.  \n",
    "2. Compare them against a predefined list of **preferred domains** (e.g., `arxiv.org`, `nature.com`, `nasa.gov`).  \n",
    "3. Compute the **ratio of preferred vs. total results**.  \n",
    "4. Return a **PASS/FAIL flag** along with a Markdown-formatted summary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a reproducible, low-cost metric that tells us whether the research component — and only this step from the graded lab — is pulling from trusted sources.\n",
