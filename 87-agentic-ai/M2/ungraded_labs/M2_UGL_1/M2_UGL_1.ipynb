    "\n",
    "Think of these labs as **sandbox**: a safe practice space where you can deepen your understanding of the course concepts, build confidence, and get ready for the graded exercises that come later. In each lab, try running the code cells to see some agentic workflows in action and better understand how they work. \n",

    "\n",
    "In this ungraded lab, you will implement the **reflection pattern** introduced in the lecture video within an agentic workflow that generates data visualizations. A multi-modal LLM will review the first draft chart, identify potential improvements‚Äîsuch as chart type, labels, or color choices‚Äîand then rewrite the chart generation code to produce a more effective visualization.\n",

    "In the video, Andrew presented the following workflow for analyzing coffee sales. You will implement this in code here. The steps that the workflow will carry out are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate an initial version (V1):**\n",
    "Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to create the first version of the plotting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execute code and create chart:** \n",
    "Run the generated code and display the resulting chart. ** (check everywhere)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflect on the output:**\n",
    "Evaluate both the code and the chart using an LLM to detect areas for improvement (e.g., clarity, accuracy, design).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate and execute improved version (V2):**\n",
    "Produce a refined version of the plotting code based on reflection insights and render the enhanced chart.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now it‚Äôs time to wrap everything into a single automated workflow the agent can run from start to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `run_workflow` function links together the components you implemented earlier:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Load and prepare data** ‚Äî via `utils.load_and_prepare_data(...)`.  \n",
    "2) **Generate V1 code** ‚Äî with `generate_chart_code(...)`, which returns the first-draft matplotlib code (wrapped in `<execute_python>` tags).  \n",
    "3) **Execute V1 immediately** ‚Äî the workflow extracts the code between `<execute_python>` tags and runs it to produce the first chart image.  \n",
    "4) **Reflect and refine** ‚Äî `reflect_on_image_and_regenerate(...)` critiques the V1 image (and the original code) against the instruction, returns concise **feedback** plus **revised code (V2)**.  \n",
    "5) **Execute V2 immediately** ‚Äî the refined code is extracted and executed to generate the improved chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this workflow accepts\n",
    "- **`dataset_path`**: location of the input CSV.  \n",
    "- **`user_instructions`**: the chart request (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate a plot comparing Q1 coffee sales in 2024 and 2025 using the data in coffee_sales.csv.‚Äù).  \n",
    "- **`generation_model`**: model used for the initial code generation.  \n",
    "- **`reflection_model`**: model used for the image-based reflection and code refinement.  \n",
    "- **`image_basename`**: base filename for saving chart images (e.g., `chart_v1.png`, `chart_v2.png`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The chart execution steps are intentionally **hard-coded** to run right after code generation/refinement. This mirrors the workflow in the lecture and ensures you see each draft‚Äôs output before moving on.\n"
