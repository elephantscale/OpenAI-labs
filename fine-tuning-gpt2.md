# How to finetune gpt3 model

Here are the general steps to fine-tune the GPT-2 model:

## STEP 0) Set up your environment:
* Install Python 3.6 or higher.
* Install TensorFlow 1.15 or higher.

## STEP 1) Get the model

* Clone the official OpenAI GPT-2 repository: https://github.com/openai/gpt-2.
* Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Download the GPT-2 model:
* Download the pre-trained GPT-2 model of your choice (there are four sizes: 125M, 355M, 774M, and 1.5B). You can use the download_model.py script provided in the repository to download the model.


## STEP 2) Prepare your dataset:
* Collect a dataset of text files for fine-tuning. This dataset should be in a format where each text file contains a single training example.
* Preprocess and tokenize the dataset using the encode.py script provided in the repository. This script will convert your text files into a format suitable for training (an npy file).

## Fine-tune the GPT-2 model:
* Use the train.py script to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset. You may need to modify the script to specify the model size, dataset location, and other hyperparameters.
* Be aware that fine-tuning can take a long time, especially for larger models, and may require a powerful GPU.

## STEP 3) Test the fine-tuned model:

* Once the fine-tuning is complete, you can use the interact.py script to test the model's performance interactively. You can input text prompts, and the fine-tuned model will generate responses based on its new training.

## Congratulations!
