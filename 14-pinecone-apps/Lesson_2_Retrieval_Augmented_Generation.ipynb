Once you've done an initial run, consider increasing this value to 750 or 1,000. You'll likely notice that the context provided to the LLM becomes richer and better. You can experiment by gradually raising this variable for different queries to observe the improvements in the LLM's contextual understanding.</p>"

      "The Berlin Wall was a physical barrier that divided the city of Berlin from 1961 to 1989. It was built by the communist government of East Germany to prevent citizens from fleeing to the democratic West. The wall was a symbol of the Cold War and the division between the communist and capitalist ideologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The construction of the wall began on August 13, 1961, and it consisted of a concrete wall, barbed wire, and guard towers. The wall was 155 kilometers long and 3.6 meters high, with a \"death strip\" in between the two sides. This strip was heavily guarded and contained anti-vehicle trenches, trip-wire machine guns, and guard dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Berlin Wall was not only a physical barrier but also a psychological one. Families and friends were separated, and people were unable to visit their loved ones on the other side. The wall also divided the city's infrastructure, such as roads, railways, and utilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wall was heavily guarded, and anyone who attempted to escape faced imprisonment or even death. However, over the years, many people risked their lives to cross the wall, and some were successful. The most famous escape was in 1962 when a group of students tunneled under the wall and escaped to the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, marked the end of the Cold War and the reunification of Germany. The announcement of the new travel law by the East German government sparked a series of events that led to the wall's destruction. Thousands of East Germans swarmed into West Berlin, and the guards were overwhelmed. The wall was breached, and people began to tear it down, symbolizing the end of the communist regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Berlin Wall is a significant historical landmark and a reminder of the city's tumultuous past. Parts of the wall have been preserved and turned into a memorial, with graffiti and artwork depicting the wall's history. The fall of the Berlin Wall is a testament to the power of the people and their desire for freedom and unity.\n"
